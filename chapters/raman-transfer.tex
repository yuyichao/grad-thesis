\section{Raman Transfer versus STIRAP}

An alternative method often used to create and prepare the internal states of ultracold molecule
is stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP)\todo{\cite{}}.
Compared to off-resonance Raman transition, which uses detuning from the excited state
to reduce scattering during the transfer, STIRAP relies on a superposition between
the initial and final state as a dark state to achieve the same goal.
The dark state in STIRAP is created due to a destructive interference of transition
from the initial and final state to the excited state.

Similar to Raman transfer, STIRAP in an ideal three-level system can achieve
full coherent transfer with arbitrarily small scattering probability
when given unlimited time and power budget.
However, in reality, states and coupling that exist outside the ideal three-level system
always have a non-zero probability of scattering loss.
In this section, we will apply the approach we took for Raman transition
and apply it to STIRAP. We will then compare the loss caused by different practical limitations
and discuss which approach should be taken under certain circumstance.
