\chapter{Coherent Optical Creation of NaCs Molecule}
\label{ch:raman-transfer}

\section{Introduction}
\label{ch:raman-transfer:introduction}

The coherent production of weakly bound ground state NaCs molecule is an important milestone
in our two-step approach of creating rovibronic ground state molecules with full control.
Achieving this goal using only optical transition without a narrow excited state linewidth
can allow more laser-coolable atoms to be associated to molecules coherently.
With the characterization of both the excited and ground molecular potential,
we have calibrated all the parameters needed to drive such a transition.
Nevertheless, the wavefunction size mismatch between the atomic and molecular states
remains a challenge that requires careful selection of the transition pathway.

In this chapter, we will discuss the considerations behind our choice of parameters
and show the result of the coherent molecule creation.
We begin with section~\ref{ch:raman-transfer:raman} to setup a model
for a realistic Raman transition beyond the ideal three-level system.
Section~\ref{ch:raman-transfer:stirap} follows a similar track and constructs a model
for stimulated Raman adiabatic passage~(STIRAP),
which is another common way to drive such a two-photon transition
and comparing it to the Raman transition.
Section~\ref{ch:raman-transfer:state-selction} uses the result from the previous sections
to finalize our molecule creation pathway.
The result of the molecule creation is given in section~\ref{ch:raman-transfer:results},
which also includes discussion on the transfer efficiency.

\section{Raman Transition Beyond Three-Level Model}
\label{ch:raman-transfer:raman}

For a Raman transition with Raman Rabi frequency $\Omega_{\mathrm{R}}$ and total scattering rate
$\Gamma$, defined as the sum of the scattering rate for the initial and final states,
the probability of scattering during a $\pi$ pulse is,
\begin{align*}
  p_{\mathrm{s}}=&\frac{\Gamma t_{\pi}}{2}\\
  =&\frac{\pi\Gamma}{2\Omega_{\mathrm{R}}}
\end{align*}
which is proportional to the ratio $\Gamma/\Omega_{\mathrm{R}}$.
In an ideal three-level system, this is the only source of decoherence
which can be made arbitrarily small by using a large
single photon detuning~(section~\ref{ch:rsc:basic-theory:raman-scatter}).
However, in a real system, there are often other effects that increases the scattering
and may also put a lower limit on the scattering probability during the transfer.
Fig.~\ref{fig:raman-transfer:generic-raman-model} shows a generic model
for a real Raman transition demostrating some of these effects.
Additionally, other practical limitation in the system like stability of the laser power
and frequency also needs to be taken into account.

\begin{figure}

  \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{figures/raman_transfer_generic_raman_model.pdf}
  \caption[Generic model for a real Raman transition]{
    Generic model for a real Raman transition.
    The initial state $|i\rangle$ and the final state $|f\rangle$
    has a energy difference $\delta$
    and are coupled by two Raman beams with frequencies and
    single photon Rabi frequencies of $\nu_1,\ \Omega_1$ and $\nu_2,\ \Omega_2$ respectively.
    The corresponding matrix elements (arbitrary unit) are $M_1$ and $M_2$.
    The Raman beams are detuned by $\Delta$ from the primary excited state $|e\rangle$,
    which has a decay rate of $\Gamma_e$.
    We also consider additional states near the initial~($|i'\rangle$),
    final~($|f'\rangle$) and intermediate excited $|e'\rangle$ states which are
    separated from the corresponding Raman transition states by $\omega'_i$,
    $\omega'_f$ and $\omega'_e$ respectively.
    Only one additional state of each kinds are included to simplify the discussion
    without loss of generality.
    \label{fig:raman-transfer:generic-raman-model}}
\end{figure}

In the experiment, we find the parameter range that gives the best transfer efficiency
using numerical simulation~(section~\ref{ch:raman-transfer:state-selction}).
Nevertheless, in order to develop a general approach that can be applied to other systems,
it is also important to understand the various physical mechanism that leads
to the optimal parameters.
Therefore, in this section, we will discuss some of the most important effects
on the transfer efficiency at qualitative and semiquantitative level.
Due to experimental constraint, we will assume that the single photon detuning is
much smaller than the frequency of each individual beams, i.e. $\Delta\ll\nu_1,\ \nu_2$.

\subsection{Additional Initial and Final States}
\label{ch:raman-transfer:raman:extra-init-final}

First, we will discuss the effect of $|i'\rangle$ and $|f'\rangle$ states
near the initial and final states.
These states can be coupled to the excited state $|e\rangle$ by the Raman beams,
which can in tern be coupled to the initial and final states
by an off-resonance Raman transition.
The leakage is suppressed by the detuning from the Raman resonance,
i.e. $\omega'_i$ and $\omega'_f$.
This puts a limit on the Raman Rabi frequency $\Omega_{\mathrm{R}}$ to be smaller
than the smallest energy gap, which in turns puts a limit on the minimum Raman transfer time.
In our experiment, the minimum energy gap comes from axial motional excitation of
the atomic initial states which is between $2\pi\times10 - 30~\mathrm{kHz}$
depending on the trap depth used.
The typical Raman $\pi$ time we can realize is $0.5 - 5~\mathrm{ms}$ so this effect
is not a major limiting factor for our transfer efficiency.

\subsection{Additional Excited States}
\label{ch:raman-transfer:raman:extra-ext}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/raman_transfer_extra_ext_states.pdf}
  \caption[Raman transition with additional excited states]{
    Effect of additional excited states $|e'\rangle$ on the Raman transition efficiency.

    or destructive~(orange) interference on the Raman Rabi frequency $\Omega_{\mathrm{R}}$.

    (C) Optimal detunine exists between the two states with maximum transfer efficiency

    \label{fig:raman-transfer:raman:extra-ext-states}}
\end{figure}

Next, we will consider the effect of the $|e'\rangle$ state near the excited intermediate state.
These states can be coupled to the ground states, both $|i\rangle$ and $|f\rangle$,
by the Raman beams and can cause a change in both the Raman Rabi frequency
and the scattering rate.
There are two relevant limiting cases that needs to be discussed separately.

\subsubsection{Excited State Spacing Larger than Single-Photon Detuning}
\label{ch:raman-transfer:raman:extra-ext:large-spacing}
In this case, the single photon frequency falls in between the two excited states
$|e\rangle$ and $|e'\rangle$,
which happens when $|e'\rangle$ is a different vibrational or electronic state.
The total Raman Rabi frequency~(Fig.~\ref{fig:raman-transfer:raman:extra-ext-states}A) is,
\[
  \Omega_{\mathrm{R}}=\frac{\Omega_1\Omega_2}{2\Delta}+\frac{\Omega'_1\Omega'_2}{2(\Delta-\omega'_e)}
\]
where $\Omega'_1$ and $\Omega'_2$ are the single photon Rabi frequencies coupling $|e'\rangle$
to $|i\rangle$ and $|f\rangle$ respectively.
Depending on whether $\Omega'_1\Omega'_2$ has the same~(orange line)
or different~(blue line) sign as $\Omega_1\Omega_2$, the total Raman Rabi frequency
may be cancelled or enhanced between the two excited states.
On the other hand,
the total scattering rate~(Fig.~\ref{fig:raman-transfer:raman:extra-ext-states}B)
is almost always increased due to the additional state, creating a local minimum
between the excited states.
Combining the two effects, the ratio between the Raman Rabi frequency and
the scattering rate, which determines the transfer efficiency, always have local maximum
between the excited states~(Fig.~\ref{fig:raman-transfer:raman:extra-ext-states}C).

Despite the difference in the position and value of the maximum for different
$|e'\rangle$ parameters, we can summarize the effect on the transfer efficiency
as a limit on the maximum detuning $\Delta_{\max}$ to a fraction of the spacing
between the excited states~($\omega'_e$).
As an example, the blue and orange maxima in
Fig.~\ref{fig:raman-transfer:raman:extra-ext-states}C
corresponds to a limit on single photon detuning of $0.5\omega'_e$ and $0.15\omega'_e$.
As one would expected, a larger excited state spacing usually result in
a larger detuning limit and a better transfer efficiency.

Summarizing the effect of additional excited state as a single number $\Delta_{\max}$ allows
us to keep using the equation for Raman transition with minor corrections
and makes it easier to compare different state selection and transition schemes.
It is also worth noting that although only one additional excited state $|e'\rangle$
is considered here, this result can be generalized when more excited states are taken into account
as well. These states introduces additional smooth variation in both the Raman Rabi frequency
and scattering rate and the effects on the final transition efficiency can be similarly
treated as a change in the maximum detuning.

\subsubsection{Excited State Spacing Much Smaller than Single-Photon Detuning}
\label{ch:raman-transfer:raman:extra-ext:tight-spacing}
This is typically the case when $|e'\rangle$ is a different rotational or hyperfine state.
In this case, the Raman transition is detuned from both $|e\rangle$ and $|e'\rangle$
at the same time and the two excited states behaves similar to an effective state $|e''\rangle$
with modified coupling strengths and decay rate.

When the initial and final ground states have (nearly) identical spin and rotational state,
which is the case for the our transition to $N=0$ states
discussed in section~\ref{ch:raman-spectroscopy:states:n0},
the new effective state will behave very similar to the original ones.
This is because the coupling between the ground states and excited states is determined by,
\begin{align*}
  \Omega_{1,2}^{i}=&\Omega_{1,2}^{0}\langle\mathrm{F}_e^i|\mathrm{F}_g\rangle
\end{align*}
where the superscript $i$ represents different excited states,
the subscript $1,2$ represents the initial~(1) and final~(2) ground state,
$\Omega_{1,2}^{0}$ is the reduced Rabi frequency without the angular momentum projection,
and $\mathrm{F}_e^i$ and $\mathrm{F}_g$ are the rotation and spin state for the excited
and ground state respectively. Note that the ground states $|i\rangle$ and $|f\rangle$
both have the same $\mathrm{F}_g$. This means
\begin{align*}
  \frac{\Omega_1^{i}}{\Omega_2^{i}}=&\frac{\Omega_1^{0}}{\Omega_2^{0}}
\end{align*}
which is a constant.
Given that the excited state linewidth for different rotation and hyperfine states
are very similar, we have the Rabi frequency to scattering rate ratio.
\begin{align*}
  \frac{\Omega_{\mathrm{R}}}{\Gamma_{\mathrm{s}}}\approx&\paren{\sum_i\frac{\Omega_1^i\Omega_2^i}{2\Delta}}\left/\paren{\sum_i\frac{{\Omega_1^i}^2+{\Omega_2^i}^2}{4\Delta^2}}\right.\\
  =&\frac{\Omega_1\Omega_2}{2\Delta}\left/\frac{{\Omega_1}^2+{\Omega_2}^2}{4\Delta^2}\right.
\end{align*}
which is the same as the expression for a single excited state.

The properties of the effective state can be very different, however,
when the initial and final spin and rotational states are different.
Nevertheless, other than the special case of complete destructive interference
on the Raman Rabi frequency,
the new excited state will generally have a worse ratio $\Omega_{\mathrm{R}}/\Gamma_{\mathrm{s}}$
by a constant factor.
The dependency of the ratio on the detuning is not changed significantly
for large detuning.

\subsection{Cross Coupling Between Light Addressing Initial and Final States}
\label{ch:raman-transfer:raman:cross-couple}

Due to the small energy separation between the initial and final state $\delta$,
the cross coupling of the laser addressing the initial/final state on the final/initial state
is another important effect in our experiment.
Without the cross coupling, the total off resonance scattering rate for
the initial and the final states is
\[
  \Gamma_{\mathrm{s}0}=\frac{\Gamma_e\left(\Omega_1^2+\Omega_2^2\right)}{4\Delta^2}
\]
For a given Raman Rabi frequency $\Omega_{\mathrm{R}}\propto\Omega_1\Omega_2$, this is
minimized when $\Omega_1=\Omega_2$.

When cross coupling is taken into account, however, the total scattering rate becomes,
\footnote{Here we assume that the matrix elements are the same for the two beams.
  This is the case when the two beams have the same polarization as in our experiment.
  This effect can be minimized or eliminated by selecting different polarizations for the
  two laser frequencies that does not couple to the other initial/final state.
  This would also require choosing an excited state with the same or lower angular momentum
  as the ground states in order to avoid cross coupling to different excited states.}
\begin{align}
  \Gamma_{\mathrm{s}}=&\frac{\Gamma_e\Omega_1^2}{4M_1^2}\left(\frac{M_1^2}{\Delta^2}+\frac{M_2^2}{(\Delta+\delta)^2}\right)+\frac{\Gamma_e\Omega_2^2}{4M_2^2}\left(\frac{M_2^2}{\Delta^2}+\frac{M_1^2}{(\Delta-\delta)^2}\right)\\
  \propto&\frac{\Gamma_eP_1}{4}\left(\frac{M_1^2}{\Delta^2}+\frac{M_2^2}{(\Delta+\delta)^2}\right)+\frac{\Gamma_eP_2}{4}\left(\frac{M_2^2}{\Delta^2}+\frac{M_1^2}{(\Delta-\delta)^2}\right)
\end{align}
where $P_{1,2}\propto\Omega_{1,2}^2/M_{1,2}^2$ are the powers of the laser beams 1 and 2.
When $\delta\ll\Delta$ such as our experiment,
\begin{align*}
  \Gamma_{\mathrm{s}}\approx&\frac{\Gamma_e\left(M_1^2+M_2^2\right)}{4\Delta^2}\left(\frac{\Omega_1^2}{M_1^2}+\frac{\Omega_2^2}{M_2^2}\right)\\
  \propto&\frac{\Gamma_e\left(M_1^2+M_2^2\right)}{4\Delta^2}\left(P_1+P_2\right)
\end{align*}
For a given Raman Rabi frequency $\Omega_{\mathrm{R}}\propto\Omega_1\Omega_2\propto\sqrt{P_1P_2}$,
this is minimized when $P_1=P_2$.
Hence, due to the strong cross coupling, we need to use the same power in both Raman beams
rather than adjusting the powers to match their single photon Rabi frequencies.

Moreover, at the minimum scattering rate, we have $\Omega_2=\Omega_1M_2/M_1$
and the ratio between Raman Rabi frequency and scattering rate is,
\begin{align*}
  \frac{\Omega_{\mathrm{R}}}{\Gamma_{\mathrm{s}}}=&\frac{\Omega_1\Omega_2}{2\Delta}\frac{4\Delta^2}{\Gamma_e\left(M_1^2+M_2^2\right)}\left/\left(\frac{\Omega_1^2}{M_1^2}+\frac{\Omega_2^2}{M_2^2}\right)\right.\\
  =&\frac{2\Delta\Omega_1\Omega_2}{\Gamma_e\left(M_1^2+M_2^2\right)}\left/\left(\frac{\Omega_1^2}{M_1^2}+\frac{\Omega_2^2}{M_2^2}\right)\right.\\
  =&\frac{\Delta\Omega_1^2M_2}{\Gamma_eM_1\left(M_1^2+M_2^2\right)}\frac{M_1^2}{\Omega_1^2}\\
  =&\frac{\Delta}{\Gamma_e}\frac{M_1M_2}{M_1^2+M_2^2}
\end{align*}
Therefore, for a given excited state linewidth $\Gamma_e$
and maximum detuning~(section~\ref{ch:raman-transfer:raman:extra-ext}) the transfer efficiency
maximizes for the smallest $M_1M_2/(M_1^2+M_2^2)$ which happens when the ratio
$M_1/M_2$ is the closest to $1$.

The light shift of the Raman resonance is similarly affected by the cross coupling.
The differential light shift between the initial and the final state determines
the resonance fluctuation as a function of light intensity fluctuation.
The ration between the light shift and the Raman Rabi frequency, i.e. line width,
determines the stability requirement of our laser indensity.
With cross coupling, the differential shift is (assuming $\delta\ll\Delta$),
\begin{align*}
  \Delta\delta\approx&\frac{\Omega_1^2}{4\Delta}-\frac{\Omega_1^2M_2^2}{4\Delta M_1^2}-\frac{\Omega_2^2}{4\Delta}+\frac{\Omega_2^2M_1^2}{4\Delta M_2^2}\\
  =&\frac{M_1^2-M_2^2}{4\Delta}\left(\frac{\Omega_1^2}{M_1^2}+\frac{\Omega_2^2}{M_2^2}\right)\\
  \propto&\frac{M_1^2-M_2^2}{4\Delta}\left(P_1+P_2\right)
\end{align*}
which is also minimized when $P_1=P_2$ at a given Raman Rabi frequency.

The ratio with the Raman Rabi frequency is,
\begin{align*}
  \frac{\Delta\delta}{\Omega_{\mathrm{R}}}\approx&\frac{M_1^2-M_2^2}{4\Delta}\left(\frac{\Omega_1^2}{M_1^2}+\frac{\Omega_2^2}{M_2^2}\right)\frac{2\Delta}{\Omega_1\Omega_2}\\
  =&\frac{M_1^2-M_2^2}{2\Omega_1\Omega_2}\left(\frac{\Omega_1^2}{M_1^2}+\frac{\Omega_2^2}{M_2^2}\right)\\
  =&\frac{M_1^2-M_2^2}{M_1M_2}
\end{align*}
the absolute value of which is also minimized when the ratio $M_1/M_2$ is the closest to $1$.

Due to the coupling strength difference, we have $M_2\gg M_1$ in our experiment, which means,
\begin{align*}
  \left|\frac{\Delta\delta}{\Omega_{\mathrm{R}}}\right|\approx&\frac{M_2}{M_1}
\end{align*}
In order to keep the resonance stable within the linewidth of the Raman resonance,
i.e. $\Omega_{\mathrm{R}}$, we need to maintain a relative stability of $\Delta\delta$,
therefore relative stability of the laser power to better than $M_1/M_2$.

\section{STIRAP}
\label{ch:raman-transfer:stirap}

An alternative method often used to create and prepare the internal states of ultracold molecule
is stimulated Raman adiabatic passage~(STIRAP)~\cite{vitanov_coherent_2001}.
Compared to Raman transition, which uses detuning from the excited state
to reduce scattering during the transfer, STIRAP relies on a superposition between
the initial and final state as a dark state to achieve the same goal.
The dark state in STIRAP is created due to a destructive interference of transition
from the initial and final state to the excited state.

Similar to Raman transfer, STIRAP in an ideal three-level system can achieve
full coherent transfer with arbitrarily small scattering probability
when given unlimited time and power budget.
However, in reality, states and coupling that exist outside the ideal three-level system
always cause a non-zero probability of
scattering loss~(Fig.~\ref{fig:raman-transfer:generic-stirap-model}).
In this section, we will apply the approach we took for Raman transition to STIRAP.
We will then compare the loss caused by different practical limitations
and discuss which approach should be taken under certain circumstance.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{figures/raman_transfer_generic_stirap_model.pdf}
  \caption[Generic model for a real STIRAP]{
    Generic model for a real STIRAP similar to Fig.~\ref{fig:raman-transfer:generic-raman-model}.
    Differences are that the two beams are now on resonant with $|e\rangle$
    and the $\Omega_1$ and $\Omega_2$ now represent the maximum single photon Rabi frequency
    during the STIRAP pulse for the two beams.
    \label{fig:raman-transfer:generic-stirap-model}}
\end{figure}

\subsection{STIRAP for Ideal Three-Level System}
\label{ch:raman-transfer:stirap:three-level}

During STIRAP, the system approximately remains in a dark state $|D(t)\rangle$
\begin{align*}
  |D(t)\rangle=&c_i(t)|i\rangle+c_f(t)|f\rangle
\end{align*}
Since this state does not couple to the excited state, we have,
\begin{align*}
  0=&\langle e|\mathbf{d}\cdot\mathbf{E}|D(t)\rangle\\
  =&c_i(t)\langle e|\mathbf{d}\cdot\mathbf{E}|i\rangle
     +c_f(t)\langle e|\mathbf{d}\cdot\mathbf{E}|f\rangle\\
  =&c_i(t)\Omega_1(t)+c_f(t)\Omega_2(t)
\end{align*}
or
\begin{align*}
  |D(t)\rangle=&\frac{\Omega_2(t)|i\rangle-\Omega_1(t)|f\rangle}{\sqrt{\Omega_1^2(t)+\Omega_2^2(t)}}
\end{align*}
In order to estimate the scattering rate,
we use the fact that the wavefunction amplitude in the final state $c_f$
is the integral of the excited state amplitude $c_e$ and the down leg Rabi frequency $\Omega_2$,
i.e.,\footnote{This equation and the lower bound on scattering probability applies generically
  to all two photon transfer process including Raman $\pi$ pulse.
  The equation we used in section~\ref{ch:raman-transfer:raman} is a refinement
  on this limit.}
\begin{align*}
  c_f(t)=&\int_0^t \frac{\ui\Omega_2(t)}{2}c_e(t') \ud t'
\end{align*}
For a complete transfer of length $T$, we have $c_f(0)=0$ and $c_f(T)=1$, therefore,
\begin{align*}
  \int_0^T\Omega_2(t)c_e(t)\ud t=&-2\ui
\end{align*}
Since $\Omega_2$ is the upper bound of $\abs{\Omega_2(t)}$ we have,
\begin{align*}
  \abs{\int_0^Tc_e(t)\ud t}\geqslant&\frac{2}{\Omega_2}
\end{align*}
The total scattering probability is,
\begin{align*}
  p_{\mathrm{s}0}=&\int_0^T \Gamma_e|c_e^2(t)| \ud t\\
  \geqslant&\frac{\Gamma_e}{T}\abs{\int_0^T c_e(t) \ud t}^2\\
  \geqslant&\frac{4\Gamma_e}{\Omega_2^2T}
\end{align*}
From similar argument, we also have,
\begin{align*}
  p_{\mathrm{s}0}\geqslant&\frac{4\Gamma_e}{\Omega_1^2T}
\end{align*}
which is the same as the previous result for a three-level STIRAP system
where $\Omega_1=\Omega_2$.
In the generic case, these give us a lower bound on the scattering probability,
\begin{align*}
  \min\paren{p_{\mathrm{s}0}}=&\frac{4\Gamma_e}{\min\paren{\Omega_1^2, \Omega_2^2}T}
\end{align*}
whereas the full scattering is larger than this lower bound by a pulse shape dependent
small constant factor.
It is also easy to verify that this result agrees with the scattering probability for
a optimal three-level Raman $\pi$ with similar single photon Rabi frequency and pulse time.
This confirms that without additional constraint from the real system or the experimental setup,
neither Raman transfer or STIRAP offers a significant advantage over the other.
As we will see in the following sections,
other effects in the system can favor one approach over the other one.

\subsection{Additional Initial and Final States}
\label{ch:raman-transfer:stirap:extra-init-final}

Similar to Raman transition~(section~\ref{ch:raman-transfer:raman:extra-init-final}),
the additional initial and final states causes potential leakage out of the three-level system.
This limits the minimum time of the transfer in a way similar to that of Raman transition.

\subsection{Additional Excited States}
\label{ch:raman-transfer:stirap:extra-ext}

For additional excited states that are farther away than the single photon Rabi frequency
$\Omega_1$ and $\Omega_2$, the contribution to the coherent transfer is minimum.
However, these states can still contribute to scattering during the transfer.

Excited state will only contribute significantly to the scattering if it causes scattering
from the dark state, which happens if $\Omega_1(t)/\Omega_2(t)\neq\Omega'_1(t)/\Omega'_2(t)$,
where $\Omega'_1(t)$ and $\Omega'_2(t)$ are the time dependent single photon Rabi frequencies
coupling $|e'\rangle$ to $|i\rangle$ and $|f\rangle$ respectively.
As discussed in section~\ref{ch:raman-transfer:raman:extra-ext:tight-spacing},
this does not happen for excited state with the same vibrational and electronic states
when the initial and final spin and rotational states are identical.
Similar to $\Omega_1$ and $\Omega_2$, we can also define
$\Omega'_1\equiv\max\paren{\Omega'_1(t)}$ and $\Omega'_2\equiv\max\paren{\Omega'_2(t)}$.
Since $\Omega'_1(t)$($\Omega'_2(t)$) and $\Omega_1(t)$($\Omega_2(t)$)
are generated from the same beam, we have
$\Omega'_1(t)\propto\Omega_1(t)$($\Omega'_2(t)\propto\Omega_2(t)$)
and the condition can also be equivalently expressed as
$\Omega_1/\Omega_2\neq\Omega'_1/\Omega'_2$.

More quantitatively,
the Rabi frequency coupling the dark state $|D(t)\rangle$ to the excited state $|e'\rangle$ is,
\begin{align*}
  \Omega'(t)=&\langle e'|\mathbf{d}\cdot\mathbf{E}|D(t)\rangle\\
  =&\frac{\Omega_2(t)\Omega'_1(t)-\Omega_1(t)\Omega'_2(t)}{\sqrt{\Omega_1^2(t)+\Omega_2^2(t)}}\\
  =&\frac{\Omega_1(t)\Omega_2(t)}{\sqrt{\Omega_1^2(t)+\Omega_2^2(t)}}\paren{\frac{\Omega'_1}{\Omega_1}-\frac{\Omega'_2}{\Omega_2}}
\end{align*}
The addtional scattering caused by this is,
\begin{align*}
  p'_{\mathrm{s}}=&\int_0^T \frac{\Gamma'_e\Omega'^2(t)}{4{\omega'_e}^2} \ud t\\
  =&\frac{\Gamma'_e}{4{\omega'_e}^2}
     \paren{\frac{\Omega'_1}{\Omega_1}-\frac{\Omega'_2}{\Omega_2}}^2
     \int_0^T \frac{\Omega_1^2(t)\Omega_2^2(t)}{\Omega_1^2(t)+\Omega_2^2(t)} \ud t\\
  =&C'\frac{\Gamma'_eT}{4{\omega'_e}^2}
     \paren{\frac{\Omega'_1}{\Omega_1}-\frac{\Omega'_2}{\Omega_2}}^2
     \frac{\Omega_1^2\Omega_2^2}{\Omega_1^2+\Omega_2^2}
\end{align*}
which has the form of an off-resonance scattering probability.
$C'$ is a dimensionless number depending only on the pulse shape defined as
\begin{align*}
  C'\equiv&\frac{\Omega_1^2+\Omega_2^2}{\Omega_1^2\Omega_2^2T}\int_0^T \frac{\Omega_1^2(t)\Omega_2^2(t)\ud t}{\Omega_1^2(t)+\Omega_2^2(t)}
\end{align*}

It is worth noting that although there aren't two different cases similar to
the discussion for Raman transition in section~\ref{ch:raman-transfer:raman:extra-ext}
due to the lack of detuning in STIRAP,
the difference between excited states with different spacings may still play an important role
when comparing Raman transition to STIRAP.
This is discussed breifly at the end of
section~\ref{ch:raman-transfer:stirap:raman-vs-stirap:extra-ext}.

\subsection{Cross Coupling Between Light Addressing Initial and Final States}
\label{ch:raman-transfer:stirap:cross-couple}

As is the case for Raman transition~(section~\ref{ch:raman-transfer:raman:cross-couple}),
the coupling of each beam on the other initial or final state can cause increased scattering.
The total scattering probability caused by the cross coupling is
\footnote{Here we are making the same assumption of identical matrix elements for the two beams
  as the one we made for Raman transition in section~\ref{ch:raman-transfer:raman:cross-couple}.},
\begin{align*}

where $C''_1$ and $C''_2$ are two dimentionless numbers

\end{align*}

\subsection{Raman Transfer versus STIRAP}
\label{ch:raman-transfer:stirap:raman-vs-stirap}

As one may expect, the scattering probability and the efficiency of a STIRAP transfer
depends on the precise pulse shape used.
While it may be possible to construct a STIRAP pulse shape
with significantly different constant values,
we will focus our discussion on more traditional shapes and assume
$C''_1\approx C''_2\approx C'\approx1$.

We will compare the scattering probability during STIRAP to that of
Raman $\pi$ pulse in two limiting case depending on whether the contribution
from the additional excited or ground state are more significant.

\subsubsection{More Significant Contribution from Additional Excited State}
\label{ch:raman-transfer:stirap:raman-vs-stirap:extra-ext}

This is the case where excited state separation $\omega_e'$ is significantly smaller compared
to the ground state separation $\delta$.
By choosing an optimal pulse time, the minimum scattering probability for the STIRAP is,
\begin{align*}
  p_{\mathrm{s}}^{\mathrm{STIRAP}}\approx&2\sqrt{\frac{4\Gamma_e}{\min\paren{\Omega_1^2, \Omega_2^2}}\frac{\Gamma'_e}{4{\omega'_e}^2}\paren{\frac{\Omega'_1}{\Omega_1}-\frac{\Omega'_2}{\Omega_2}}^2\frac{\Omega_1^2\Omega_2^2}{\Omega_1^2+\Omega_2^2}}\\
  =&\frac{\sqrt{\Gamma_e\Gamma'_e}}{\omega'_e}
     \abs{\frac{\Omega'_1}{\Omega_1}-\frac{\Omega'_2}{\Omega_2}}
     \frac{2\max\paren{\Omega_1, \Omega_2}}{\sqrt{\Omega_1^2+\Omega_2^2}}\\
  \geqslant&\frac{\sqrt{\Gamma_e\Gamma'_e}}{\omega'_e}
             \abs{\frac{\Omega'_1}{\Omega_1}-\frac{\Omega'_2}{\Omega_2}}
\end{align*}
For Raman $\pi$ pulse,
\begin{align*}
  p_{\mathrm{s}}^{\mathrm{Raman}}=&\frac{\pi\Gamma}{2\Omega_{\mathrm{R}}}\\
  =&\frac{\pi}{2}\frac{\Gamma_e\paren{\Omega_1^2+\Omega_2^2}}{4\Delta_{\max}^2}
     \frac{2\Delta_{\max}}{\Omega_1\Omega_2}\\
  =&\frac{\pi\Gamma_e}{4\Delta_{\max}}\frac{\paren{\Omega_1^2+\Omega_2^2}}{\Omega_1\Omega_2}\\
  \geqslant&\frac{\pi\Gamma_e}{2\Delta_{\max}}
\end{align*}
The last inequality for both take the equal sign when $\Omega_1=\Omega_2$.
Comparing the result and note that $\Delta_{\max}$ is a fraction of $\omega_e'$,
we see that the two scales similarly to the excited state spacing.
However, given that in the common cases we have $\Delta_{\max}<\omega_e'$ and
$\abs{\Omega'_1/\Omega_1-\Omega'_2/\Omega_2}<1$ using STIRAP can potentially reduce
the total scattering in this case.

Note that the discussion above implicitly assumes that the relevant $\omega_e'$
is the same for Raman transition and STIRAP.
However, as we saw in section~\ref{ch:raman-transfer:stirap:extra-ext} and
\ref{ch:raman-transfer:raman:extra-ext:tight-spacing},
this may not be the case for hyperfine and rotational structure
in the excited state when the initial and final states have different spin states.
The $\omega_e'$ for STIRAP in this case is the hyperfine or rotational splitting
and may be significantly smaller compared to the $\omega_e'$ for Raman transition,
which is the vibrational state spacing.
As a result, STIRAP may not be as favorable compared to Raman anymore.
The best option in this case would require more in-depth comparison
of the different effects and will not be discussed here in more detail
since it is not relevant in our experiment.

\subsubsection{More Significant Contribution from Additional Ground State}
\label{ch:raman-transfer:stirap:raman-vs-stirap:cross-couple}

With the assumption of $C''_1\approx C''_2\approx1$ the scattering due to
cross coupling for STIRAP is now,
\begin{align*}
  p''_{\mathrm{s}}=&\frac{\Gamma_eT}{4\delta^2}\paren{\frac{M_2^2}{M_1^2}\frac{\Omega_1^4}{\Omega_1^2+\Omega_2^2}+\frac{M_1^2}{M_2^2}\frac{\Omega_2^4}{\Omega_1^2+\Omega_2^2}}\\
  \geqslant&\frac{\Gamma_eT}{2\delta^2}\paren{\Omega_1^2+\Omega_2^2}\frac{M_1^2M_2^2}{\paren{M_1^2+M_2^2}^2}
\end{align*}
and the minimum is taken when $M_2/M_1=\Omega_2/\Omega_1$\footnote{Same as Raman transition.}
The minimum total scattering rate for STIRAP is therefore,
\begin{align*}
  p_{\mathrm{s}}^{\mathrm{STIRAP}}\approx&2\sqrt{\frac{4\Gamma_e}{\min\paren{\Omega_1^2, \Omega_2^2}}\frac{\Gamma_e}{2\delta^2}\paren{\Omega_1^2+\Omega_2^2}\frac{M_1^2M_2^2}{\paren{M_1^2+M_2^2}^2}}\\
  =&2\sqrt{2}\frac{\Gamma_e}{\delta}\frac{M_1M_2}{M_1^2+M_2^2}\frac{\sqrt{\Omega_1^2+\Omega_2^2}}{\min\paren{\Omega_1, \Omega_2}}\\
  =&2\sqrt{2}\frac{\Gamma_e}{\delta}\frac{\max\paren{M_1, M_2}}{\sqrt{M_1^2+M_2^2}}\approx2\sqrt{2}\frac{\Gamma_e}{\delta}
\end{align*}
For Raman transition
\begin{align*}
  p_{\mathrm{s}}^{\mathrm{Raman}}=&\frac{\pi\Gamma}{2\Omega_{\mathrm{R}}}\\
  =&\frac{\pi\Gamma_e}{2\Delta}\frac{M_1^2+M_2^2}{M_1M_2}\\
  \approx&\frac{\pi\Gamma_e}{2\Delta}\frac{\max\paren{M_1,M_2}}{\min\paren{M_1,M_2}}
\end{align*}
we can see that when the single photon Rabi frequency is changed to minimize
cross coupling scattering, the Raman transition can be more strongly affected by
the matrix element imbalance. However, if the Raman transition can use a detuning
\[
  \Delta>\frac{\max\paren{M_1,M_2}}{\min\paren{M_1,M_2}}\delta
\]
then the scattering probability for a Raman transition can be made smaller than that of STIRAP.

\subsubsection{Conclusion}

In our experiment, we have an initial and final state separation of $<\!1~\mathrm{GHz}$
and an matrix element ratio of $<\!30$.
This means that as long as we can use a single photon detuning of more than
$\approx\!30~\mathrm{GHz}$, the total scattering probability for Raman transition
will be smaller than that of STIRAP.
Since this detuning can be achieved easily,
a Raman $\pi$ pulse should be preferred in our experiment.

The comparison so far has been focused on the scattering probability from the Raman or STIRAP
beams. There are also a few other more technical reasons we preferred Raman versus STIRAP
in our experiment.

\begin{enumerate}
\item We use the tweezer beam as the Raman beam for transfer in order to reduce scattering
  from external sources~(section~\ref{ch:raman-spectroscopy:states}).
  Doing this for STIRAP while optimizing the pulse shape for transfer is more challenging.
\item In additional to scattering, the additional excited and ground state
  also causes a power, and therefore time, dependent light shift.
  A STIRAP in the presence of these shifts must vary the frequency of the two beams
  in additional to the power in order to maintain the dark state.
  This is also technically challenging to do.
\end{enumerate}

As a summary, for two photon transfer to a weakly bound molecular state,
it is likely that Raman transition is the preferred technique.
However, for transfering to a deeply bound molecular state,
which is where STIRAP is used in previous experiments,
STIRAP can have an advantage over Raman transition.

\section{States Selection}
\label{ch:raman-transfer:state-selction}

From section~\ref{ch:raman-transfer:raman} we see that the transfer efficiency
is directly related to the excited state linewidth, the maximum usuable detuning
and the matrix elements ratio~($M_1/M_2$).
In this section, we will discuss how these, as well as other technical constraints
affects the choices of states we use for the Raman transfer.

\subsection{Initial Atomic State}
\label{ch:raman-transfer:state-selction:init}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.625\textwidth]{figures/raman_transfer_atomic_wavefunction.pdf}
  \caption[Enhancement of short range wavefunction]{
    Enhancement of short range wavefunction.
    The large scattering length for the $\mathrm{Na(2,2),Cs(3,3)}$ state
    creates an interaction shift comparable to the axial trapping frequency.
    This causes a significant change in the relative wavefunction especially at short
    intranuclear distance~($R$).
    Compared to other spin states with weaker interaction,
    the wavefunction at short distance~($R<100~\text{\AA}$) is significantly enhanced.
    \label{fig:raman-transfer:atomic-wavefunction}}
\end{figure}

The choice of initial state can affect the transfer efficiency
by changing the matrix element $M_1$ and therefore the matrix elements ratio.
Since for most choices of the atomic and molecular states we have $M_1<M_2$,
we would like to choose an atomic initial state with the largest $M_1$ possible.
Unlike the selection of final state~(section~\ref{ch:raman-transfer:state-selction:final})
maximizing $M_1$ can improve the matrix element ratio as well as
shortening the transfer time to decrease sensitivity to technical noise at the same time.

As discussed in section~\ref{ch:pa:linewidth},
$M_1$ is only sensitive to the wavefunction at a short inter-atomic distance
that is comparable to the size of the molecule.
Therefore, states with a large wavefunction value at short inter-atomic distance
should generally have a larger $M_1$.
In additional to the confinement potential and the motional state of the atoms,
this is also affected by the interaction between the atoms.
A stronge interaction, either attractive or repulse,
can significantly change the relative motional wavefunction of the atoms.
This effect can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:raman-transfer:atomic-wavefunction}
and is especially significant for the $|\mathrm{Na(2,2),Cs(3,3)}\rangle$ state
when the interaction energy scale is comparable to that of the motional energy
as seen in section~\ref{ch:interaction-shift:spectroscopy:results}.

\subsection{Excited State}
\label{ch:raman-transfer:state-selction:ext}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/raman_transfer_theory_ratio_v0_vs_vhi.pdf}
  \caption[Comparison between using a weakly bound and a deeply bound excited state
  as intermediate state for the Raman transition]{
    Comparison between using a weakly bound and a deeply bound excited state
    as intermediate state for the Raman transition.
    The (A) deeply bound excited state~($v'=0$) has a smaller
    Raman Rabi frequency`($\Omega_{\mathrm{R}}$) compared to the
    (B) weakly bound excited state~($v'=63$) at a given detuning.
    However, the lower scattering rate~($\Gamma_{\mathrm{s}}$) allows a much larger
    $\Delta_{\max}$,
    which results in a larger Raman Rabi frequency to scattering rate ratio.
    \label{fig:raman-transfer:v0-vs-v63}}
\end{figure}

Based on theory calculation, most of the molecular excited states have a linewidth $\Gamma_e'$
very similar to that of the Cesium D lines between $2\pi\times5~\mathrm{MHz}$ to
$2\pi\times10~\mathrm{MHz}$ due to optical decay process.
States above the Cesium $\mathrm{6^2P_{1/2}}$ state,
however, could non-radiatively decay to the Cs $\mathrm{6^2P_{1/2}}$
and Na $\mathrm{3^2S_{1/2}}$ states
via pre-dissociation which significantly increases the linewidth and should be avoided.

The other factor that affects excited state selection is the maximum detuning $\Delta_{\max}$.
Due to larger FCF with the ground atomic and weakly bound molecular state,
previous attempt at Raman spectroscopy typically use an excited state
closed to the dissociative threshold as
the intermediate state~\cite{wynar_molecules_2000,rom_state_2004}.
However, the smaller inter-state spacing and the smaller detuning from
the atomic excited state means that these state have a relatively small $\Delta_{\max}$
and therefore a lower coherent transfer efficiency.
On the other hand, a deeply bound excited state has a significantly higher $\Delta_{\max}$
and is the preferred choice for coherent Raman transfer.

In the experiment, we use numerical simulation to calculate the Raman transfer efficiency
for any given Raman beam wavelength taking into account of all states of
the $\mathrm{c^3\Sigma^+}(\Omega = 1)$
excited molecular state potential~\cite{grochola_spin-forbidden_2011}
and the continuum~\cite{liu_ultracold_2017}.
Fig.~\ref{fig:raman-transfer:v0-vs-v63} shows the result near a deeply bound
and weakly bound excited state.
Despite having a lower Raman Rabi frequency,
the deeply bound state has significantly higher transfer efficiency
and is used as the intermediate state for coherent Raman transfer in our experiment.

\subsection{Final Molecular State}
\label{ch:raman-transfer:state-selction:final}

In additional to the scattering and light shift considertions discussed above,
the transition can also be affected by external magnetic field.
We minimize the effect of magnetic field noise on the transition by using molcular
and atomic states that are in the same molecular potential,
i.e. molecular bound state in the potential that asymptote to
the atomic state. For weakly bound molecular state,
i.e. binding energy smaller than or comparable to the hyperfine energy scale,
this ensures that the atomic and molecular states has maximally overlapping spin state
and therefore a small differential Zeeman shift that can affect the Raman resonance frequency.
The similarity in the spin state between the initial and final states
also minimizes the effect of hyperfine and rotational states near the excited states
as we have seen in section~\ref{ch:raman-transfer:raman:extra-ext:tight-spacing}.

Because of the weak coupling between the atomic and molecular states,
the Raman transition has a relatively low Rabi frequency.
This also means a longer transfer time over which the Raman lasers must remain coherent.
In order to lower the requirement on our Raman and tweezer laser,
we select the first bound state, i.e. smallest binding energy, as the final molecular state.
This ensures the maximum Raman Rabi frequency.
Additionally, the typical binding energy for these states are $<\!1~\mathrm{GHz}$
which is a frequency difference that can be generated using AOM's
so that the coherence between the two beams is greatly improved.

\section{Raman Transfer Results}
\label{ch:raman-transfer:results}

The setup and sequence for forming the molecule is very similar to that of the Raman spectsocopy
previously mentioned in section~\ref{ch:raman-spectroscopy:states:raman-tweezer}
that drives the two-photon transition by adding a second frequency to the tweezer light.
Nevertheless, a few changes were made to the sequence in order to improve
the transfer efficiency and the signal to noise.
\begin{enumerate}
\item The initial $|\mathrm{Na(2,2),Cs(3,3)}\rangle$ state is prepared by driving the
  interaction shift resonance from $|\mathrm{Na(2,2),Cs(4,4)}\rangle$
  after the two atoms are merged into the same tweezer.
  As discussed in section~\ref{ch:interaction-shift:summary},
  the strong interaction between the atoms allows preparation of
  relative motional ground state with low background.
\item Instead of using smaller detuning and longer time to maximize the signal of the resonance,
  we increased the single photon detuning to $145~\mathrm{GHz}$
  and use short pulse times~($<\!1~\mathrm{ms}$)
  to reduce the scattering and the linewidth of the resonance.
\item We added an narrow bandpass filter to reduce the spectral noise from the laser.
  This will be discussed in more detail below in section~\ref{ch:raman-transfer:results:ase}.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/raman_transfer_fit_one_ase_init.pdf}
  \caption[Raman resonance with Fourier limited linewidth and Rabi flopping.]{
    (A) Raman resonance after optimizing for transfer coherence,
    showing a Fourier limited linewidth.
    The solid line shows a fit to a Lorentzian line shape used to determine the linewidth.
    (B) Time scan on the Raman Resonance, showing coherent Rabi oscillations.
    \label{fig:raman-transfer:results:init}}
\end{figure}

With these changes, the narrowest linewidth we were able to observe using $15~\mathrm{mW}$
of total power in the tweezer is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:raman-transfer:results:init}A.
The full width half maximum~(FWHM) of $7.45(51)~\mathrm{kHz}$ is consistent
with the Fourier limited linewidth of $7~\mathrm{kHz}$
for a $\pi$-pulse of $0.12~\mathrm{ms}$ used in the experiment.
This is evidence that the linewidth is mainly determined by the Raman Rabi frequency
rather than the lifetime of the molecule, suggesting that we are in the coherent regime.
We can confirm this by varying the pulse time on the Raman resonance
and the resulting decaying Rabi flopping can be seen in
Fig.~\ref{fig:raman-transfer:results:init}B.
The coherence in the molecule creation signals the successful transfer
of the control of single atoms to the control on the single molecule.
Becasue of this, the molecules we created are in a single internal spin state
with higher than $60~\mathrm{\%}$ probability
of being in the motional ground state in the tweezer.

Based on the Rabi flopping signal, we can infer that $57~\mathrm{\%}$ of the atoms
that were prepared in the relative motional ground state have been transfered to the molecule.
This is the first time coherent optical transfer from atoms to molecules has been demostrated
without the help of an excited state with narrow linewidth.
Nevertheless, the transfer efficiency is lower than the prediction from the theory,
which, we believe, is caused by the molecule lifetime.
Below, we will discuss some of the possible cause for the transfer efficiency.
In section~\ref{ch:raman-transfer:results:ase} we will focus on technical sources
and in section~\ref{ch:raman-transfer:results:scaling}
we will measure the properties of the molecular state and the transition
in order to compare it to the theory prediction.

\subsection{Effect of laser spectral noise}
\label{ch:raman-transfer:results:ase}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/raman_transfer_spectra.pdf}
  \caption[Tweezer spectra before and after ASE filter.]{
    Spectra of the tweezer beam (A) before and (B) after the ASE filter.
    The power in the desired output frequency from the laser is $20\sim200~\mathrm{\mu W}$
    where the uncertainty is caused by saturation of the spectrum analyser.
    This saturated range is shown as the vertical blue bands in both plots.
    The exact position of this band depends on the scan setting
    which causes it to be slightly different between the two spectra.
    (A) The spectrum before the ASE filter clearly shows a broad band spectral impurity
    approximately matching the gain bandwidth of the laser diode.
    This noise spans tens of nm and can potentially cover multiple molecular excited states
    causing increased scattering.
    (B) With the ASE filter, the spectrum is consistent with the background.
    \label{fig:raman-transfer:results:ase:spectra}}
\end{figure}

One of the most important technical sources affecting the transfer efficiency
is the spectral noise from the tweezer.
The $1038~\mathrm{nm}$ tweezer light we used is generated
by amplifing a external-cavity diode laser~(ECDL) seed using a Raman fiber amplifier.
In a typical ECDL setup using grating feedback,
although the external cavity selects a single preferred mode
within the gain bandwidth of the laser diode in the feedback path,
the output path does not have a similar filter
allowing the amplified spontaneous emission~(ASE)
from the diode to get into the laser output.
We observed this effect on our laser using an optical spectrum analyser,
as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:raman-transfer:results:ase:spectra}A.
Although the absolute power in the ASE is very low,
it could resonantly couple to multiple molecular lines
causing significant scattering during the Raman transition.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.65\textwidth]{figures/raman_transfer_fit_zero_ase_time.pdf}
  \caption[Rabi flopping without ASE filter.]{
    Rabi flopping without ASE filter showing a shorter coherence time.
    The condition is othersize identical with Fig.~\ref{fig:raman-transfer:results:init}B.
    \label{fig:raman-transfer:results:ase:zero}}
\end{figure}

Fortunately, this is a common problem for systems with a large number of excited states,
especially molecules, and ASE filters have been developed to address this.
In our experiment, we use SureBlock ultra narrow-band notch filter from Ondax
with part number 114-ER407-015,
which is based on a volume holographic grating and has a FWHM of $\approx\!30~\mathrm{GHz}$.
We added the filter after the Raman fiber amplifier\footnote{
  Before passing through the beampath shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:raman-spectroscopy:raman-beampath}
} and the spectrum of the laser after the filter is shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:raman-transfer:results:ase:spectra}B.
As mentioned above, this is the condition under which the Rabi flopping
in Fig.~\ref{fig:raman-transfer:results:init}B is taken.
Comparing it to a similar measurement without the ASE filter shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:raman-transfer:results:ase:zero},
we can see the filter clearly improved the contrast of the oscillation.
More quantitatively, the Raman Rabi frequency is not affected by the filter as expected
whereas the coherence time of the oscillation increased from $0.170(10)~\mathrm{ms}$
to $0.244(19)~\mathrm{ms}$ when the ASE filter is added.
It is worth noting that depending on the wavelength range of the spectral noise,
more precisely the FCF of the transition within the range,
the scattering rate measurement can be more sensitive than the spectrum analyser.
In particular, noise on the level of
$\approx\!0.1~\mathrm{ppm/nm}$~($\approx\!0.01~\mathrm{nW/nm}$
in Fig.~\ref{fig:raman-transfer:results:ase:spectra}) near the atomic transition wavelength
is enough to cause kHz of scattering.
Because of this, we only use Fig.~\ref{fig:raman-transfer:results:ase:spectra}B
to qualitatively confirm the effectness of the filter
but rely on the specification of the filter
to estimate the cleaness of the spectrum after the fiter.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/raman_transfer_fit_two_ase.pdf}
  \caption[Signal improvement with a second ASE filter after the fiber.]{
    (A) Rabi flopping and (B) molecule lifetime measurement
    with a second ASE filter after the fiber showing further reduction in scattering rate.
    \label{fig:raman-transfer:results:ase:two}}
\end{figure}

In additional to the diode laser, broad spectral noise has also been observed
from the non-linear effect in the fiber.
Although we cannot see such noise on the spectrum directly,
we checked whether this has an effect on the molecule by adding another ASE filter after
the last fiber in the beam path.
The best result from these tests is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:raman-transfer:results:ase:two}A
which indeed shows an improvement in the coherence time to $0.398(17)~\mathrm{ms}$.
We also measured the molecular lifetime under this condition directly
by preparing the molecule with a $\pi$-pulse
and then using a second $\pi$-pulse to dissociate the molecule back to atoms
after a variable wait time.
The result in Fig.~\ref{fig:raman-transfer:results:ase:two}B
shows a molecular lifetime of $0.1992(87)~\mathrm{ms}$
consistent with the decay of the Rabi oscillation.
However, adding the filter after the fiber potentially has negetive impact
on other properties of the tweezer including beam shape,
power variation and pointing fluctuation,
we were not yet able to make consistent measurement using this setup.
Future experiments using a beam path that better integrate the filter
needs to be used to investigate the effect of the tweezer noise more accurately.

\subsection{Scaling of Raman Transition Parameters}
\label{ch:raman-transfer:results:scaling}

The Rabi flopping signal shown above is caused by a combination of
many effects~(including the ones shown in section~\ref{ch:raman-transfer:raman}),
making it difficult to identify the reason for the transfer efficiency
that is lower than expected.
Because of this, we vary various experimental parameters
and measure how they affect the Raman transition.
This allows us to distinguish between different mechanisms based
on their different responses to the parameters.
As mentioned in section~\ref{ch:raman-transfer:results:ase},
due to the potential issues with the ASE filter after the fiber,
the setup using one ASE filter before the fiber is currently the most reliable configuration
that offers the lowest scattering rate.
Therefore, for the measurements in this section,
this is the setup we used to measure the scattering rate.
For properties that are not directly related to scattering,
for example light shift and Rabi frequency,
we will also use data that was taken before the ASE filter was added.

The parameters that we can easily vary about the transition
are the power and the detuning of the tweezer\footnote{
  We of course also vary the Raman pulse time and the two photon detuning
  but these are used to determine the transition parameters
  and are not treated as different conditions.}.
The tweezer power changes the single photon Rabi frequencies
both by changing the field strength and by changing the confinement
which affects the relative atomic wavefunction but not the molecular wavefunction.
We will compare the measured power scaling with the theory calculation
to check for unknown loss mechanisms.
Based on the discussion about extra excited states
in section~\ref{ch:raman-transfer:raman:extra-ext},
we see that for most properties of the Raman transition,
there is a term attributed to
the desired excited state $|e\rangle$~(i.e. the $v'=0$ state)
and other terms that are caused by the combined effect of other excited states.
As a function of the single-photon detuning,
the first term scales the same way as a simple three-level Raman transition
whereas the second term can have more complex scaling but generally varies slower
than the first term due to the larger detunings from the excited states involved.
In the study below, we will treat the contribution from other states as a constant background
\footnote{Constant here means independent of the single photon detuning.
  It could, however, depend on other variables including the tweezer power.}
over the range of frequencies we scan.
In another word, we fit the detuning dependency of each properties
as an offset plus the contribution from the $v'=0$ state~(either $1/\Delta$ or $1/\Delta^2$).
We will focus more on the $v'=0$ term since it is easier to compare to the theory prediction.
However, we will also discuss the effect of the background term on the transfer efficiency.

The properties we can directly measure from the transitions are
the resonance frequency~$f_{\mathrm{R}}$, Raman Rabi frequency~$\Omega_{\mathrm{R}}$,
and the two scattering rates for the atomic~$\Gamma_{\mathrm{a}}$
and molecular states~$\Gamma_{\mathrm{m}}$.
We measure these by fitting both the time~(i.e. Rabi flopping)
and frequency scan to a single model.
For a measurement of the Raman transition at frequency $f$,
the time evolution of the system is determined by,
\begin{align*}
  \begin{pmatrix}
    \psi_{\mathrm{a}}(t)\\
    \psi_{\mathrm{m}}(t)
  \end{pmatrix}=&\ue^{-\ui Ht}\begin{pmatrix}
    \psi_{\mathrm{a}}(0)\\
    \psi_{\mathrm{m}}(0)
  \end{pmatrix}=\ue^{-\ui Ht}\begin{pmatrix}
    1\\
    0
  \end{pmatrix}\numberthis{eq:raman-transfer:results:scaling:model}
\end{align*}
where the effective non-Hermition Hamiltonian $H$ is
\begin{align*}
  H=&-\frac{\ui}{2}\begin{pmatrix}
    \Gamma_{\mathrm{a}}+\ui\paren{f-f_{\mathrm{R}}}&\Omega_{\mathrm{R}}\\
    -\Omega_{\mathrm{R}}&\Gamma_{\mathrm{m}}-\ui\paren{f-f_{\mathrm{R}}}
  \end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}

The survival of both Na and Cs atom after the Raman transition
is fitted to $\abs{\psi_{\mathrm{a}}(t)}$ from Eq.~\ref{eq:raman-transfer:results:scaling:model}.
Additionally, since the atomic loss rate $\Gamma_{\mathrm{a}}$
is slow compared to the Raman transition time,
it is measured separately using the two-body lifetime of the atoms
to obtain a more accurate number.
An example of such fitting is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:raman-transfer:results:init}B
and \ref{fig:raman-transfer:results:fit}.
which result in the fitting parameters shown in table~\ref{table:raman-transfer:results:fit}.

After repeating this for multiple tweezer power $P$ and frequencies $f_{\mathrm{twr}}$,
we first look at the light shift of the transition.
The resonance frequencies are fitted to the formula,
\begin{align*}
  f_{\mathrm{R}}=&\paren{f_{\mathrm{R}0}+a\cdot P+b\cdot P^2}
                   +\frac{c\cdot P}{f_{\mathrm{PA0}} - f_{\mathrm{twr}}}
                   \numberthis{eq:raman-transfer:results:light-shift}
\end{align*}
where the first term is the background contridution
and the second term is the one due to $v'=0$ state.
Since we have $\Omega_2^2\gg\Omega_1^2$, we assume $v'=0$ term is only caused by
the coupling between excited state $|e\rangle$ and the final molecular state $|f\rangle$.
Taking into account the cross coupling effect, we have,
\begin{align*}
  c\cdot P=&\frac{\Omega_2^2}{2}\numberthis{eq:raman-transfer:results:light-shift0}
\end{align*}
For the background term, we have the ``raw'' resonance frequency\footnote{
  Note that Zeeman shift is still included.} $f_{\mathrm{R}0}$,
a linear term $a\cdot P$ caused by the scalar AC Stark shift from other states
and a quadratic term $b\cdot P^2$ that we attribute to the vector AC Stark shift.
In principle the vector AC Stark shift may also depend on the single-photon detuning
but the dependency is not significant within the frequency range we measured.

the near linear dependency of the light shift on the tweezer power.
The fitting parameters are shown in table~\ref{table:raman-transfer:results:light-shift}.
Most importantly, the down-leg Rabi frequency is $2\pi\cdot90.645(50)~\mathrm{MHz/\sqrt{mW}}$
or $2\pi\cdot351.07(19)~\mathrm{MHz}$ for $15~\mathrm{mW}$ tweezer power.

The background light shift is $2.194(17)~\mathrm{kHz/mW}$
which results in $\approx\!8~\mathrm{\%}$ of the light shift for the previous measurement
and is not a significant factor.

Next we study the Raman Rabi frequency.
Unlike the light shift, this quantity is strongly affected by the coupling
between the atomic state and the excited molecular state.
For weak confinement and interaction,
this coupling scales as the amplitude of the wavefunction at zero relative distance,
or square root of the probability density,
which scales as $P^{0.375}$ for a 3D harmonic trap\footnote{
  $\abs{\psi(0)}^2\propto{\displaystyle\prod_{i=x,y,z}}\beta_i^{-1}\propto{\displaystyle\prod_{i=x,y,z}}\omega_i^{1/2}\propto P^{3/4}$}.
For stronger confinement and interaction, however,
this scaling starts to saturate as the scattering length $a$ approaches
the harmonic oscillator length $\beta$ and does not follow a simple power law scaling anymore.
This is the regime we have for the strongly interacting $|\mathrm{Na(2,2),Cs(3,3)}\rangle$ state.
Nevertheless, in order to simplify the fitting,
we use numerical calculation to determine an approximate scaling of $P^{0.29}$
for our scattering length within the range of tweezer power we measure.
This results in a scaling of $\Omega_{\mathrm{R}}$ proportional to $P^{1.29}$
which can be verified using measurements with the same tweezer frequency at different powers,
as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:raman-transfer:results:rabi}A.

We fit the $\Omega_{\mathrm{R}}$ for different detuning to the following model,
\begin{align*}
  \Omega_{\mathrm{R}}=&\paren{a+\frac{b}{f_{\mathrm{PA0}} - f_{\mathrm{twr}}}}\cdot P^{1.29}
                        \numberthis{eq:raman-transfer:results:rabi}
\end{align*}
where $a$ and $b$ are the coefficient for the background and the $v'=0$ terms respectively.
This is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:raman-transfer:results:rabi}B
and the fitting parameters are shown in table~\ref{table:raman-transfer:results:rabi}
For the $v'=0$ term, we have
\begin{align*}
  b\cdot P^{1.29}=&\frac{\Omega_1\Omega_2}2
\end{align*}
Combining with the previous measurement of the down-leg Rabi frequency,
this gives an up-leg Rabi frequency of $2\pi\cdot617.8(72)~\mathrm{kHz/mW^{0.79}}$.
The value for $15~\mathrm{mW}$ tweezer power is $2\pi\cdot5.248(61)~\mathrm{MHz}$
for a Rabi frequency ratio $\Omega_2/\Omega_1$ of $66.90(79)$.
This ratio verifies the assumption $\Omega_2^2\gg\Omega_1^2$ made above for
the light shift model.

The background component fitted has opposite sign
with the $v'=0$ term for red detuned tweezer which reduces $\Omega_{\mathrm{R}}$
by $\approx\!35~\mathrm{\%}$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:raman-transfer:results:init}B.
The relative sign should change when the tweezer frequency is tuned
to be higher than the excited molecular state resonance
causing an increase in $\Omega_{\mathrm{R}}$.
Unfortunately, we have observed another excited molecular state
$\approx\!200~\mathrm{GHz}$ higher than $|e\rangle$
which increases the scattering and
makes it difficult to drive coherent transition on the blue side.

    Dependency of atomic scattering rate $\Gamma_{\mathrm{a}}$

    The dashed lines fit to $a\cdot P^{1.58}$ as expected from theory
    that has poor agreement with the data.
    The solid lines fit to $b\cdot P^{2.58}$ with much better agreement with data.
    The fitting results for tweezer frequencies of
    $288503~\mathrm{GHz}$ and $288560~\mathrm{GHz}$ are
    $b_{288503}=2\pi\cdot29.3(17)~\mathrm{mHz/mW^{2.58}}$
    and $b_{288560}=2\pi\cdot24.5(13)~\mathrm{mHz/mW^{2.58}}$ respectively.
    The scaling behavior and the lack of sensitivity to tweezer frequency
    suggests that the scattering from the atomic state is dominated
    by other excited states or technical noise
    and is potentially a two-photon scattering process.
    \label{fig:raman-transfer:results:scaling:gamma-atom}}
\end{figure}

Next we move on to the scattering rates.
Based on the scaling of $P^{0.29}$ for the coupling
between the atomic state and the excited molecular state,
we expect the atomic scattering rate $\Gamma_{\mathrm{a}}$ to scale as $P^{1.58}$.
However, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:raman-transfer:results:scaling:gamma-atom},
the scaling is very closed to $P^{2.58}$ instead.
This suggests that a two photon scattering process is potentially involved.
Furthermore, the plot also shows that the scattering rate does not depend strongly
on the tweezer frequency meaning that almost all of the contribution
are from other excited state or laser noise.
This scaling behavior is unexplained by our current theory.
Nevertheless, as we will see soon, the absolute value of the scattering rate
is much smaller than that from the molecular state
and is therefore not limiting the transfer efficiency.

    The fitting results for tweezer frequencies of
    $288503~\mathrm{GHz}$ and $288560~\mathrm{GHz}$ are
    $a_{288503}=2\pi\cdot43.5(21)~\mathrm{Hz/mW}$

    The fitting result for the $P^2$ model is shown on the plot.
    \label{fig:raman-transfer:results:scaling:gamma-mol}}
\end{figure}

Finally, we look at the molecular scattering rate $\Gamma_{\mathrm{m}}$
which is expected to scale proportional to the tweezer power.
This agrees with the experimental data better compares to the scattering on the atomic state,
as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:raman-transfer:results:scaling:gamma-mol}A.
However, the points for higher tweezer power and smaller detuning deviates from the fit,
suggesting that there could be multiple processes with different power scaling involved.
The dependency on the tweezer frequency suggests that
part of the scattering is related to the $v'=0$ excited state\footnote{
  Note that part of the scattering is expected to be caused by the laser noise
  due to the decrease of scattering observed in section~\ref{ch:raman-transfer:results:ase}
  after adding a second ASE filter after the fiber.
}. Although we do not measure at enough tweezer frequencies to allow a fit against detuning,
we can take the difference between the two points we measured
to study the dependency on detuning and the effect from the $v'=0$ state,
as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:raman-transfer:results:scaling:gamma-mol}B.
The result shows a better agreement with $P^2$ scaling
which could be caused by a two-photon scattering process.
One possibility is for the two-photon process to couple to a state
that is $\approx\!577~\mathrm{THz}$ or $\approx\!519~\mathrm{nm}$ above the atomic states.
However, the molecular potential is not very well characterized at this energy range
so we are unable to make any theory prediction about it.
The other possibility, as discussed in section~\ref{ch:pa:linewidth:raman},
to an atomic continuum for a different hyperfine state combination.
This coupling requires changes of $m_F$ quantum number
and therefore can only be caused by polarization impurity in the tweezer.
A potential method to check for this effect in future experiment
is therefore to observe the dependency of the scattering rate on the tweezer polarization.

\section{Summary and Outlook}
\label{ch:raman-transfer:summary}

We demostrated the coherent creation of a single molecule in the optical tweezer
using only optical transitions and achieved control on all degrees of freedoms.
The technique we developed relies on fewer special properties of the system
and can be generalized to associate more laser-coolable atoms into molecules.
The transfer efficiency in our experiment appears to be limited
by an undetermined scattering mechanism which may be caused by
either the technical noise of the laser
or other process involving the molecular excited state that are not accounted for.
We discussed both possibilities based on our observations
and concluded that two likely source of the scattering are the spectral noise of the laser
and a two-photon process coupling the molecular state to an atomic state
with lower hyperfine interaction energy.
We raised questions and gave potential directions for further investigation.

Despite the limitation, the transfer efficiency may be further improved.
This is especially true for the selection
of the final state~(section~\ref{ch:raman-transfer:state-selction:final}),
which was mainly done based on technical considerations.
As an exmple, states with larger binding energies can have weaker coupling
to the excited states therefore reducing the ratio $\Omega_2/\Omega_1$
and the total scattering during the Raman transition.
This may be a promising direction to explore
but requires locking two lasers with a coherence time longer than a few milliseconds.

The creation of the weakly bound molecule in our experiment marks
the first step towards fully controlled interaction array of molecules.
As the next step, the molecules will be transferred to the rovibronic ground state
to enable the strong dipole interactions.
Combined with real-time rearrangement~\cite{barredo_atom-by-atom_2016,endres_atom-by-atom_2016},
defect-free arrays of highly controlled molecules comprise a promising
and flexible platform for quantum simulation and quantum computing applications.
