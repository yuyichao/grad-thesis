\chapter{Computer Control of the Experiment}
\label{ch:computer-control}

\section{Introduction}

The experiment sequence and data taking is managed by computers.
In additional to controlling the timing and the actions during a sequence,
the computer control system is also the main interface
between the people running the experiment (the user),
the data and the hardware performing the manipulation and measurements.
Because of its central role in the experiment,
it has to satisfy many requirements so that
the daily operation of the lab can be performed smoothly and reliably.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Full control and utilization of hardware.\\
  The control system is a layer in between the the user and the hardware
  and will abstract and manage the hardware on behave of the user.
  However, the abstraction must still allow the user to take advantage of
  the full capability of the hardware, e.g. output resolution, timing accuracy etc..
  This is because there is usually little margin between the capability of the hardware
  and the requirement in the experiment as the specification of the hardware
  is often selected based on the requirement to begin with.
\item Usability for all lab members.\\
  The lab is operated by users with specialty in physics rather than computer science.
  Although some basic knowledge of computer programming is required for operating
  the experiment as well as analysing data,
  the computer control system must be fully usable for people without any experience
  in building complex software systems.\\
  The inevitable complexity of the system must be fully hidden from the user
  for normal operations although more direct control may still be allowed in certain cases.
\item Modeling of the sequence and scan.\\
  As an important special case of usability,
  the computer control system must provide a model for each tasks closed to
  the users' mental model.
  More concretely, this means creating abstraction for concepts
  typically used to describe the task and allow operation on these abstractions
  matching the users' expectation.
  We will talk about concrete examples of this requirements
  in section \ref{ch:computer-control:frontend} regarding the sequence frontend
  and section \ref{ch:computer-control:scan} regarding scan automation.
\item Reproducibility.\\
  When exploring something new in the experiment,
  trial and error is the standard method and troubleshooting is a major part of the process.
  The ability to do this effectively requires a high degree of reproducibility of all the result.
  While it is impossible and also not the job of the computer control system to
  eliminate all the fluctuation and noise in the experiment,
  it should not add to the randomness of the system.
  With few exceptions, identical user input should produce identical output from
  the control system.
\item Version control.\\
  As a variation of the reproducibility requirement and also built on top of it,
  we must be able to revert to a previous software configuration at a later time
  in order to reproduce and double-check an earlier result.
  The use of a proper version control system on the settings and code for
  the computer control system can allow this with additional features
  including easy visualization of setting change and parallel development of code
  by multiple users.
\end{enumerate}

The design of the computer control system is mainly guided by these requirements
and we will go into more detail as we describe each part of the system.
The application programming interface (API) provided for sequence and scan programming
are mostly text based due to the flexibility and version control requirement.
Some graphic user interface (GUI) are also included for specific tasks
built on top of the text interface but will not be covered in this chapter.
Section \ref{ch:computer-control:frontend} will cover the frontend of the system
which is used by the user directly to specify an experimental sequence.
Section \ref{ch:computer-control:backend} will discuss the support for various
hardware backends used to run a sequence.
After that, section \ref{ch:computer-control:scan} describes how multiple sequences
can be put together to form a scan and
we will talk about some planned update to the system in section
\ref{ch:computer-control:summary}.

\section{Frontend}
\label{ch:computer-control:frontend}

The frontend is the main user interface of the system to specify a sequence.
Its API is designed around the following concepts.
\begin{enumerate}
\item (Sub-)sequence
\item Time step
\item Channel
\item Pulse
\end{enumerate}

(Abstraction)
(Backward compatibility)
(Flexibility)
(Text based/version control friendly)

\section{Backends}
\label{ch:computer-control:backend}
(communication protocol)
(IR)

\subsection{FPGA Backend}
(clock generation)
(pulse merging)
(compression)

\subsection{NiDAQ Backend}
(Variable clock)

\subsection{USRP Backend}
(SIMD)

\section{Automation of Scan}
\label{ch:computer-control:scan}

(Scan requirement)
(Combination of scans)
(Scope/nested structure)

\section{Summary and Outlook}
\label{ch:computer-control:summary}
(new backend/SPCM)
(native code generation, auto vectorization)
(dynamic logic and dependency tracking/optimization)
