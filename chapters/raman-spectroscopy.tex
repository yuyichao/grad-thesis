\chapter{Two-photon Spectroscopy of NaCs Ground State}
\label{ch:raman-spectroscopy}

\section{Introduction}
\label{ch:raman-spectroscopy:introduction}

The excited molecular states measured and characterized in chapter~\ref{ch:pa}
provide us a pathway to couple to the ground electronic molecular states
using two-photon transitions.
While it is in principle possible to drive from the atomic state
to any desired molecular ground state for various applications,
doing so directly has many technical challenges due to the wavefunction size mismatch.
We have observed such an effect in section~\ref{ch:pa:beampath}
where it causes a very small FCF between the excited molecular states
and the ground atomic state requiring a high PA intensity to improve the signal strength.
Because of this, we follow the approach of using a two-step process
to form rovibronic ground-state molecules,
as discussed in section~\ref{ch:introduction:tweezers:two-step}.
The first step transfer to a weakly bound molecular state makes it easier
to maintain laser coherence during the slow transition starting from the atomic state.

In this chapter, we will discuss the use of Raman spectroscopy
to measure the properties of the weakly bound molecular ground states
needed for driving a coherent transition to form the molecule.
In section~\ref{ch:raman-spectroscopy:states}
we will describe the states involved and the setup for the Raman spectroscopy
as well as the measured binding energy for the $N=0$ states.
In section~\ref{ch:raman-spectroscopy:n2}
we study the coupling between angular momenta for near threshold molecular states
by characterizing the $N=2$ states.

\section{Weakly Bound NaCs Ground States}
\label{ch:raman-spectroscopy:states}

As mentioned in section~\ref{ch:pa:structure:near-threshold},
the angular momentum coupling for weakly bound molecular states is similar to that of the atoms.
Therefore, instead of using the term symbol for the Hund's~case~(a)
to identify the molecular potential and bound states,
we use the hyperfine state ($F_\Na, F_\Cs$) for the atoms instead.
Similarly, since the vibrational states of the molecule do not always correspond to
a particular short range potential, we also label the vibrational states
from the atomic state threshold.
Under this system, the atomic motional ground state is $v''=0$ and
the first~(lowest binding energy) molecular bound state is $v''=-1$.

\begin{figure}

  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figures/raman_spectroscopy_scheme.pdf}
  \caption[Raman transition energy diagram]{
    States and beams in the Raman transition.
    From the initial atomic motional ground state,
    we drive a Raman transition to a weakly bound molecular ground state
    by detuning from the $\mathrm{c^3\Sigma}\paren{v'=0}$ state.
    \label{fig:raman-spectroscopy:scheme}}
\end{figure}

In order to measure the binding energy of a molecular state,
we first prepare the atom in the corresponding hyperfine state
and drive a Raman transition to the molecular state.
We use a Raman transition that is detuned from
the $\mathrm{c^3\Sigma}\paren{v'=0}$ state
measured in section~\ref{ch:pa:pa}~(Fig.~\ref{fig:raman-spectroscopy:scheme}).
When the Na and Cs are in the same tweezer,
they can undergo fast spin-exchange collisions that change the hyperfine state of the atoms.
This process can cause the hyperfine energy~($>\!1~\mathrm{GHz}$) of the atoms
to be transferred to the motional energy
and eject the atoms from the tweezer~($<\!100~\mathrm{MHz}$ deep).
As a result, the measurement can only be done when the spin-exchange collision is suppressed,
which includes the following spin combinations,
\begin{enumerate}
\item $F_\Na=1$ and $F_\Cs=3$\\
  This is the spin state with the lowest energy and therefore the spin-exchange interaction
  is energetically forbidden.
  In the experiment, we use the state $|\mathrm{Na(1, 1),Cs(3, 3)}\rangle$
  which can be prepared from the $|\mathrm{Na(2, 2),Cs(4, 4)}\rangle$ state from OP
  easily by driving a Raman transition for both the Na and Cs atoms.
  This state also remains the lowest energy atomic state
  in the presence of a weak magnetic field.
\item $|\mathrm{Na(2, 2),Cs(4, 4)}\rangle$ and $|\mathrm{Na(2, 2),Cs(3, 3)}\rangle$\footnote{
    States with opposite $m_F$, i.e.
    $|\mathrm{Na(2, -2),Cs(4, -4)}\rangle$ and $|\mathrm{Na(2, -2),Cs(3, -3)}\rangle$
    are also stable
    but are omitted here since these cannot be easily prepared in our experiment.}\\
  These spin states are stable because the spin-exchange collision conserves the total $m_F$
  of the two atoms and
  the two states are the lowest energy states that have the same total $m_F$.
  An inelastic collision that changes the total $m_F$ happens at a lower rate
  since it requires transferring angular momentum between the spin and motion of the atom.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Driving Raman Transition using the Optical Tweezer}
\label{ch:raman-spectroscopy:states:raman-tweezer}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/raman_spectroscopy_apparatus_sequence.pdf}
  \caption[Raman transition setup and sequence]{
    (A) Geometry and polarization of trap and Raman beam relative to the bias magnetic field.
    We use a bias B field of $B_0=8.8~\mathrm{G}$ alone the tweezer polarization
    to define the quantization axis
    which is the same as the one used for Raman sideband cooling in
    Fig.~\ref{fig:rsc:na-geometry}.
    As a result, the atoms experience predominantly $\pi$ polarization from the tweezer.
    (B) Raman transition pulse sequence.
    The tweezer initially consists of only up leg power.
    When driving the Raman transition, the up leg power is smoothly ramped down and
    the down leg power ramped up over $t_{\mathrm{ramp}}=10~\mathrm{\mu s}$
    while maintaining the total power of the tweezer.
    This minimizes the heating on the atoms due to power fluctuation while maximizing the time
    with maximum Raman Rabi frequency when the up and down leg powers are equal.
    \label{fig:raman-spectroscopy:apparatus-sequence}}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/raman_spectroscopy_raman_beampath.pdf}
  \caption[Beam path to allow driving Raman transition with tweezer]{
    Beam path for generating the frequency for Raman transition in the tweezer.
    (Beam path for fiber coupling and overall power control is not shown.)
    The red beam path is the $0$-th order of the double pass~(DP) AOM
    which is used for the tweezer.
    When the DP AOM is turned on, some power is redirected to the first order
    (blue beam path) which generates the required frequency difference to drive
    the Raman transition. The two frequencies are recombined on the DP AOM.
    The $0$-th order light is shifted by another single pass~(SP) AOM
    running on a different frequency before recombining.
    Without this AOM, the leak light from the DP AOM will be at the same frequency
    as the $0$-th order light which can cause a significant power fluctuation
    due to interference. The SP AOM ensures that none of the leaking light frequencies
    coincide with either intended frequencies therefore avoiding this issue.
    Different selection of the SP and DP AOM as well as their orders can be used
    to cover a wide range of two photons detuning for Raman transition.
    The experiment typically starts with the SP AOM on and the DP AOM off.
    When driving the Raman transition, the powers on both AOMs are ramped simultaneously
    to achieve the desired power at both frequencies.
    \label{fig:raman-spectroscopy:raman-beampath}}
\end{figure}

In order to increase the intensity of the Raman beams to overcome the small FCF,
we use the tweezer beam to drive
the Raman transition~(Fig.~\ref{fig:raman-spectroscopy:apparatus-sequence}A),
which maximizes the intensity due to the small focal size of the tweezer.
In addition, since the atoms are trapped at the maximum of the tweezer beam,
this also ensures that the Raman beam is aligned automatically to the atoms
and suppresses sensitivity to mechanical fluctuation that is usually
associated with a small beam size.
Moreover, this also minimizes the number of beams the atoms experience
during the Raman transition which, in turns, minimizes the scattering.
As a result, the coherence of the transition is also improved
which is important for achieving
coherent creation of molecules~(chapter~\ref{ch:raman-transfer}).

The beam path to generate the required frequencies in the tweezer is shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:raman-spectroscopy:raman-beampath}.
Due to back reflection of the acoustic wave and imperfect order separation from the AOM,
each beam may contain small frequency sidebands that are shifted from the desired one
by integer multiple of the AOM driving frequency.
Since we are combining two beams into one, such light in one beam that coincides
with the frequency of the other beam can cause large power fluctuation due to interference.
We added a single pass AOM in the beam path to shift the frequency of the red beam
away from all possible frequencies in the blue beam to avoid this issue.
The additional AOM also increases the frequency tuning range
compared to using only one double pass AOM.
The powers in each beam are calibrated as a function of AOM powers
so that we can select the desired power ratio during the experiment.
When driving the Raman transition, instead of turning on a separate beam,
we ramp down the power of the original tweezer and ramp up the power
in the second frequency while maintaining the total power to minimize heating of
the atoms~(Fig.~\ref{fig:raman-spectroscopy:apparatus-sequence}B).

\subsection{Raman Resonance on \texorpdfstring{$N=0$}{N=0} Ground State}
\label{ch:raman-spectroscopy:states:n0}

\begin{table}
  \centering
  \caption[Binding energies for $v''=-1,\ N=0$ states]{
    Binding energies and Zeeman shift for $v''=-1,\ N=0$ states.
    The theory prediction for $|\mathrm{Na(2, 2),Cs(4, 4)}\rangle$
    was calculated from the potential in~\cite{docenko_coupling_2006}.
    The prediction for the other two spin states are calculated by Jeremy Hutson
    using a coupled-channel model calibrated based on the measured binding energy
    for $|\mathrm{Na(2, 2),Cs(4, 4)}\rangle$ and the scattering length
    measured from section~\ref{ch:interaction-shift:spectroscopy:results} and
    Ref.~\cite{hood_multichannel_2020}.

  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    \multirow{2}{*}{Spin state}&\multicolumn{3}{c|}{Resonance (MHz)}&\multirowcell{2}{Zeeman shift\\(kHz/G)}\\\cline{2-4}
    {}&Theory&$8.8~\mathrm{G}$&$0~\mathrm{G}$&\\\hline
    $|\mathrm{Na(2, 2),Cs(4, 4)}\rangle$&$284$&$297.8472(28)$&$297.8510(28)$&$-0.43(10)$\\\hline

  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

We first measure the binding energy for the $v''=-1,\ N=0$ state
from the atomic states $|\mathrm{Na(2, 2),Cs(4, 4)}\rangle$, $|\mathrm{Na(1, 1),Cs(3, 3)}\rangle$,
and $|\mathrm{Na(2, 2),Cs(3, 3)}\rangle$.
The theory prediction of the binding energies are shown in
table~\ref{table:raman-spectroscopy:n0}.
Fig.~\ref{fig:raman-spectroscopy:resonance} shows the measured Raman resonance from
$|\mathrm{Na(2, 2),Cs(4, 4)}\rangle$ using $10~\mathrm{mW}$ of tweezer power at a detuning of
$-100~\mathrm{GHz}$ from the $v'=0$ excited state and a $2~\mathrm{ms}$ pulse time.

The tweezer also shifts the resonance frequency due to AC Stark shift.
We remove this effect by measuring the resonance at different tweezer powers
and extrapolate to zero trap power.
Similarly, we measure the Zeeman shift and the resonance frequency at zero magnetic field.
The summary of the results are also shown in table~\ref{table:raman-spectroscopy:n0}.
The result shows good agreement with theory prediction,
especially for the $|\mathrm{Na(1, 1),Cs(3, 3)}\rangle$, and $|\mathrm{Na(2, 2),Cs(3, 3)}\rangle$
spin states for which the theory has been calibrated using previous results from our experiment.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figures/raman_spectroscopy_spin_mixing.pdf}
  \caption[Spin state mixing near the atomic threshold]{
    Spin state mixing near the atomic threshold.
    Energy above the $s_2$ threshold only supports one molecular spin state
    so the bound state within the $s_1$ potential in this region is
    almost purely $s_1$.
    Energy below the $s_2$ threshold supports both $s_1$ and $s_2$ molecular states
    so bound states in this region may have a mixture of $s_1$ and $s_2$
    if the two spin states are coupled.
    This includes all the $s_2$ bound states and some of the $s_1$ bound states.
    \label{fig:raman-spectroscopy:spin-mixing}}
\end{figure}

Note that the Zeeman shift for the $|\mathrm{Na(2, 2),Cs(4, 4)}\rangle$ state
is significantly smaller than that for other spin states.
The reason for this is spin mixing due to magnetic coupling between states
with the same total $m_F$\footnote{The same coupling that leads to spin exchange collision.}.
The $|\mathrm{Na(2, 2),Cs(3, 3)}\rangle$ spin state is coupled to the
$|\mathrm{Na(2, 2),Cs(4, 3)}\rangle$, $|\mathrm{Na(1, 1),Cs(4, 4)}\rangle$
and $|\mathrm{Na(2, 1),Cs(4, 4)}\rangle$ states
whereas $|\mathrm{Na(1, 1),Cs(3, 3)}\rangle$ is coupled to the
$|\mathrm{Na(2, 0),Cs(4, 4)}\rangle$, $|\mathrm{Na(1, 0),Cs(4, 4)}\rangle$,
$|\mathrm{Na(2, 1),Cs(3, 3)}\rangle$, $|\mathrm{Na(1, 1),Cs(4, 3)}\rangle$,
$|\mathrm{Na(2, 1),Cs(4, 3)}\rangle$, $|\mathrm{Na(2, 2),Cs(3, 2)}\rangle$
and $|\mathrm{Na(2, 2),Cs(4, 2)}\rangle$ states.
All of these states listed above has higher energy so their bound states
may cause spin mixing with the $|\mathrm{Na(2, 2),Cs(3, 3)}\rangle$ and
$|\mathrm{Na(1, 1),Cs(3, 3)}\rangle$ bound states~(Fig.~\ref{fig:raman-spectroscopy:spin-mixing})
causing them to have a different magnetic field dependence from the corresponding atomic state
resulting in a non-zero differential Zeeman shift.
On the other hand, the $|\mathrm{Na(2, 2),Cs(4, 4)}\rangle$ bound state is above
all the other spin states and therefore has a mostly pure spin state
and the transition has little Zeeman shift.

\section{Rotational Excited NaCs Ground State}
\label{ch:raman-spectroscopy:n2}

In addition to the $N=0$ state, we also measure the energies of rotational excited states,
which verifies the rotational state for our previous results.
The precision of the Raman spectroscopy also allows us
to study the rich interaction between the nuclear rotation and atomic spin.

Due to parity conservation in the Raman transition,
the final molecular state must have an even $N$
so the lowest rotational excited state we can address is $N=2$.
We use $|\mathrm{Na(2, 2),Cs(4, 4)}\rangle$ as the initial state since,
as we saw in the previous section, the corresponding molecular bound state
has the least mixing with other molecular potentials.
Similarly, we select $F_{\mathrm{atom}}=6$ as the final total atomic spin state
since this is the state we address in the corresponding $N=0$ spectroscopy and
it includes the $m_{F_{\mathrm{atom}}}=6$ state which has minimum
Zeeman shift as discussed in the previous section.

\subsection{Angular Momentum Coupling in \texorpdfstring{$N=2$}{N=2} Ground State}
\label{ch:raman-spectroscopy:n2:angular-momentum}

Since the full Hamiltonian is rotationally symmetric for rotation around the field direction,
$m_F\equiv m_{F_{\mathrm{atom}}}+m_{N}=6$ is conserved in the Raman transition,
which includes a total of three states.
However, the exact states we are coupling to and the good quantum numbers depends on
the strength of the external fields.

At zero or very low external field, the good quantum numbers are $F$ and $m_F$
due to coupling between $\mathbf{F}_{\mathrm{atom}}$ and $\mathbf{N}$.
as discussed in section~\ref{ch:pa:structure:near-threshold}.
In this basis, the three energy eigenstates are
$|F=6,m_F=6\rangle$, $|F=7,m_F=6\rangle$ and $|F=8,m_F=6\rangle$.

External fields, both magnetic and electric\footnote{Light field from the tweezer.},
couples mostly to the atomic spin $\mathbf{F}_{\mathrm{atom}}$\footnote{
  More precisely the electron spins within $\mathbf{F}_{\mathrm{atom}}$.}
rather than the nuclear rotation $\mathbf{N}$.
Therefore, at high field $\mathbf{F}_{\mathrm{atom}}$ and $\mathbf{N}$
decouples and their projections become good quantum numbers individually.
In this case, the three energy eigenstates are
$|m_{F_\mathrm{atom}}=6,m_N=0\rangle$, $|m_{F_\mathrm{atom}}=5,m_N=1\rangle$ and
$|m_{F_\mathrm{atom}}=4,m_N=2\rangle$.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{$N=2$}{N=2} Raman Resonances}

\end{figure}

Fig.~\ref{fig:raman-spectroscopy:n2} shows the Raman spectrum taken
at $8.8~\mathrm{G}$ of magnetic field and $10~\mathrm{mW}$ of tweezer power
where three resonances can be clearly seen as expected.
This single measurement, however, does not allow us to directly identify the states
that correspond to each of the resonances.
Because of this, we measured the resonance at various tweezer powers and magnetic fields
as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:raman-spectroscopy:n2-fit}.
Each dot in the plot corresponds to an observed resonance frequency.

    in Fig.~\ref{fig:raman-spectroscopy:n2-fit} so the zero energy of the Hamiltonian is

    which also has non-zero Zeeman and AC Stark shifts.

  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

In order to understand the dependence of the resonances on the external fields
we use the following phenomenological model.
The Hamiltonian in the $m_F=6$ subspace we coupled to can be expressed as,
\begin{align*}
  H=&H_0+H_1
\end{align*}
where $H_0$ is the zero field term due to the coupling
between $\mathbf{F}_{\mathrm{atom}}$ and $\mathbf{N}$,
and the $H_1$ term is due to the coupling to external fields.
At zero external field, the eigenstates are the $F$ and $m_F$ basis
and the most generic term is,
\begin{align*}
  H_0=&E_0+\!\!\sum_{F=6,7,8}\Delta E_F|F,m_F=6\rangle\langle F,m_F=6|
\end{align*}
where $E_0$ is the ``average'' energy and $\Delta E_F$ are the shift for each $F$ states
with $\sum_{F=6,7,8}\Delta E_F = 0$.
The term for coupling to the external fields couples to the $m_{F_\mathrm{atom}},m_N$ basis
and the generic expression for such a term is,
\begin{align*}
  H_1=&\sum_{i=0,1,2}\paren{P_{\mathrm{tweezer}}\cdot a_i+B\cdot b_i}|m_{F_\mathrm{atom}}=6-i,m_N=i\rangle\langle m_{F_\mathrm{atom}}=6-i,m_N=i|
\end{align*}
where $P_{\mathrm{tweezer}}$ is the tweezer power, $B$ is the magnetic field,
and $a_i$ and $b_i$ are the state dependent AC Stark shift and Zeeman shift
of the binding energies.
We numerically diagonalize this Hamiltonian and fit to the experimental data
as shown in the lines in Fig.~\ref{fig:raman-spectroscopy:n2-fit}.
The free parameters of the Hamiltonian we obtained are shown in
table~\ref{table:raman-spectroscopy:n2}.

\section{Summary and Outlook}
\label{ch:raman-spectroscopy:summary}
Based on the study of excited molecular states using photoassociation spectroscopy,
we study the structure of the ground molecular state using Raman transitions.
Compared to the excited states, the stability of the ground-state molecules
allows us to resolve single quantum states and
control all degrees of freedoms within the molecule.
The path to coherent optical formation of ground-state molecules
is now fully cleared and this will be the focus of chapter~\ref{ch:raman-transfer}.
