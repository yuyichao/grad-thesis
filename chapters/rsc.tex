    The Raman transitions couples $|2,2;n\rangle$ and $|1,1;n+\Delta n\rangle$
    through the intermediate states $|e_i\rangle$ in the $3^2P_{3/2}$ electronic states.
    The transitions have a one-photon detuning $\Delta_i\approx75$ GHz.
    Two-photon detuning, $\delta$, is defined relative to the $\Delta n=0$ carrier transition.
    For optical pumping, we use two $\sigma^+$ polarized transitions,
    one to pump the atom state out of $|1,1\rangle$ via $3^2P_{3/2}$
    and one to pump atoms out of $|2,1\rangle$ via $3^2P_{1/2}$
    to minimize heating of the $|2,2\rangle$ state.

The relevant energy diagram and the laser frequencies for RSC are shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:na-rsc-schematics}.
We approximate the trapping potential using a harmonic oscillator.
Since this is a separable potential, we can use only the 1D motional state $|n\rangle$
and the result can be easily generalized to the full 3D system.

The cooling sequence consists of two types of pulses.
First, a Raman pulse drives the atom to a different hyperfine state while simultaneously
reduces the motional energy of the atom.
The optical pumping (OP) pulse afterwards then reset the hyperfine state of the atom
and reduce the entropy of the system.
In this section, we will discuss the theory of each types of pulses individually.
We will cover how the pulses affect cooling performance in section \ref{ch:rsc-challenges}.

\subsection{Raman Transition}
\label{ch:rsc-basic-theory-raman}

As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:na-rsc-schematics},
the cooling sequence starts with the sodium atom in the
$|s_1\rangle\equiv|2,2\rangle$ hyperfine state,
and a Raman transition is used to drive the atom to the $|s_2\rangle\equiv|1,1\rangle$ state,
where $|F,m_F\rangle$ denotes the $F$ and $m_F$ quantum number for the sodium atom.
The full Rabi frequency for such a transition is given by
\begin{align*}
  \Omega_R^0=&\sum_{i}\frac{\Omega_{1i}\Omega_{2i}^*}{2\Delta_i}
\end{align*}
where the sum is over all the coupled excited states,
$\Omega_{ai}\equiv\langle a|\mathbf{d}\cdot\mathbf{E}_a|e_i\rangle$ is the single photon
Rabi frequency between $|a\rangle$ and $|e_i\rangle$
and $\Delta_i$ is the single photon detuning from excited state $|e_i\rangle$.

In order to account for the motional degrees of freedom, we need to include the spatial
wavefunction of the atom and light into account.
As mentioned above, we approximate the atomic motional wavefunction by the harmonic oscillator
eigenstates $|n\rangle$. Coupling between states different $n$ states from the Raman transition
is allowed due to the recoil from the Raman lasers,
which corresponds to a spacial phase imprinting of $\ue^{\ui\mathbf{\Delta k}\cdot\mathbf{\hat x}}$
where $\mathbf{\Delta k}$ is the wavevector difference between the two Raman beams.
Using the creation ($\hat a^\dagger$) and annihilation ($\hat a$) operators and the relation
$\mathbf{\hat x}=\mathbf{x}_0(\hat a+\hat a^\dagger)$ where $x_0=\sqrt{\hbar/2m\omega}$
is the harmonic oscillator length, the phase factor can be expressed as
$\ue^{\ui\eta_R(\hat a+\hat a^\dagger)}$ where $\eta_R\equiv\mathbf{\Delta k}\cdot\mathbf{x}_0$
is the Lamb-Dicke parameter for the Raman transition \todo{\cite{}}.
The matrix element between motional state $|n\rangle$ and $|n'\rangle$ is therefore,
\[ M_{n,n'}=\langle n|\ue^{\ui\eta_R(\hat a+\hat a^\dagger)}|n'\rangle \]
and the final Raman Rabi frequency between motional states $n$ and $n'$ is given by,
\[ \Omega_{R}^{n,n'}=M_{n,n'}\Omega_R^0 \]
For $n=n'$, this is called a carrier transition and the others are called sideband transitions.
If the final state is higher than the initial one, i.e. $n'>n$, it is a heating sideband.
Likewise, transitions with $n'<n$ are cooling sidebands.

A closed form result for $M_{n,n'}$ is given in \todo{\cite{}},
\[ M_{n,n'}=\ue^{\eta_R^2/2}\sqrt{\frac{n_<!}{n_>!}}\eta_R^{|n-n'|}L_{n_<}^{|n-n'|}(\eta_R^2) \]
where $n_<$ and $n_>$ are the lesser and greater, respectively, of $n$ and $n'$,
and $L_n^\alpha$ is the generalized Laguerre polynomial,
\[ L_n^\alpha(x)\equiv\sum_{m=0}^n(-1)^m\begin{pmatrix}n+\alpha\\n-m\end{pmatrix}\frac{x^m}{m!} \]

An important limit is the so-called Lamb-Dicke regime defined by $\eta_R^2(2n+1)\ll 1$.
In this case, we can approximate the phase factor in leading order of $\eta_R$,
\[ \ue^{\ui\eta_R(\hat a+\hat a^\dagger)}\approx1+\ui\eta_R(\hat a+\hat a^\dagger) \]
and the matrix element
\[ M_{n,n'}\approx\delta_{n,n'}+\ui\eta_R\sqrt{n+1}\delta_{n+1,n'}+\ui\eta_R\sqrt{n}\delta_{n,n'+1} \]
the three terms corresponds to the carrier ($n'=n$),
the first order heating sideband ($n'=n+1$)
and the first order cooling sideband ($n'=n-1$) with corresponding strength
$1$, $\eta_R\sqrt{n+1}$ and $\eta_R\sqrt{n}$.
We can clearly see from this approximation that the coupling to other motional state
is stronger for a larger $\eta_R$ and higher motional quantum number $n$.
We will discuss this effect outside the Lamb-Dicke regime and its implication
on the cooling performance in more detail in section \ref{ch:rsc-challenges}.

\subsection{Optical Pumping}
\label{ch:rsc-basic-theory-op}

Driving the system on a cooling sideband with Raman transition can reduce the
motional energy of the atom. However, this is a fully coherent process that does
not reduce the system entropy and is not really ``cooling'' the system
or achieving better control on the quantum state of the system.
Instead, quantum state control is achieved in the RSC via the OP pulse.
The initial hyperfine state $|2,2\rangle$ is a stretched state so it is the
state the system naturally ends up in when $\sigma^+$ light is applied.
However, if this is done using scattering from a $F=2$ to $F'=3$ transition,
the OP beam will allow continuous photon cycle
between the $|2,2\rangle$ and the $|3',3\rangle$ causing unnecessary motional heating during OP.
Therefore, the OP must be done on a $F=2$ to $F'=2$ transition.
Unfortunately, for Na, the corresponding transition from $3^2S_{1/2}$ to $3^2P_{3/2}$
that is used for the MOT is not useable due to the small energy difference of
$60 \mathrm{MHz}$ (or $6$ line widths) between the $F'=2$ and $F'=3$ states
\cite{steck_sodium_nodate}.
Instead, we must use the sodium $\mathrm{D1}$ line, i.e. $3^2S_{1/2}$ to $3^2P_{1/2}$ transition,
which lacks a $F'=3$ excited state.
The $\mathrm{D1}$ light with $\sigma^+$ polarization is only used to pump atoms from
$F=2$ states (in particular $|2,1\rangle$ which is populated during the OP process).
Since the goal of the OP pulse is to clear the atom population in all states but $|2,2\rangle$,
the photon cycling is not a concern for $F=1$ states and the $\mathrm{D2}$ line
is used for OP of $F=1$ states instead.
This also allow us to reuse the MOT light source and simplifies our setup.

\section{Raman Sideband Thermometry}

\todo{\cite{?}}From the discussion in section \ref{ch:rsc-basic-theory-raman},
we see that the strength of the sideband transition depends on the initial motional state
as well as the Lamb-Dicke parameter $\eta_R$ of the atom.
This dependency allows us to infer the motional state of the atom
by measuring the sideband height, i.e. the so-called sideband thermometry.

In particular, for atom with temperature $T$,
the probability for the atom to be in motional state $|n\rangle$ is,
\[ p_n=\frac{\ue^{-n\hbar\omega/k_BT}}{1-\ue^{-\hbar\omega/k_BT}} \]
for a Raman pulse with full Rabi frequency $\Omega_R^0$ and time $t$,
the peak height for the first order heating (+) and cooling (-) sidebands,
\begin{align*}
  h_\pm=&\sum_{n=0}^\infty p_n\sin^2\left(\frac{\Omega_R^0t}{2}M_{n,n\pm1}\right)
\end{align*}
note that $p_{n+1}=p_n\ue^{-\hbar\omega/k_BT}$, $M_{n,n'}=M_{n',n}$ and $M_{n,-1}=0$, we have
\begin{align*}
  h_-=&\sum_{n=0}^\infty p_n\sin^2\left(\frac{\Omega_R^0t}{2}M_{n,n-1}\right)\\
  =&\ue^{-\hbar\omega/k_BT}\sum_{n=1}^\infty p_{n-1}\sin^2\left(\frac{\Omega_R^0t}{2}M_{n-1,n}\right)\\
  =&\ue^{-\hbar\omega/k_BT}h_+
\end{align*}
Therefore, if we measure the ratio of the cooling and heating sideband heights
$\alpha\equiv h_-/h_+$, we can calculate the temperature of the atom with
$\ue^{-\hbar\omega/k_BT}=\alpha$.
The corresponding ground state probability is,
\begin{align*}
  p_0=&\frac{1}{1-\ue^{-\hbar\omega/k_BT}}\\
  =&\frac{1}{1-\alpha}
\end{align*}
We will use this to experimentally characterize the performance of the cooling sequence
in the following sections.

  \caption[Beams and field geometry for Sodium Raman sideband cooling]{
    Geometry and polarizations of the Raman and optical pumping beams relative to the
    optical tweezer and bias magnetic field.
    Raman beams R1 and R4 address the radial $x$-mode.
    R1 and R2 address the radial $y$-mode.
    R3 and R4 address the axial $z$-mode, where the beams also couple to radial motion,
    but this coupling can be neglected when the atoms is cooled to the ground state of motion.
    \label{fig:na-rsc-geometry}}
\end{figure}

The geometry of all the beams and field involved is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:na-rsc-geometry}.
In order to make the cooling more efficient and simplify the sideband thermometry,
we address the motion along the three principle axis of the tweezer using different pairs
of Raman beams.
We apply an external bias magnetic field of $8.8 \mathrm{G}$ parallel to the polarization
of the tweezer beam (and orthogonal to the tweezer beam propagation direction).
This makes the field orthogonal to the effective magnetic field of the tweezer,
which minimizes the vector light shifts~\cite{kaufman_cooling_2012,thompson_coherence_2013}.
Since the optical pumping beam requires $\sigma^+$ polarization,
it is setup to propagate parallel to the applied magnetic field.

  \caption[Simulation optimized Raman sideband cooling sequence for Sodium]{
    Schematic of the cooling pulse sequence. The tweezer is strobed at 3 MHz to
    reduce light shifts during optical pumping~\cite{hutzler_eliminating_2017}.
    Each cooling cycle consists of $8$ sideband pulses.
    The four axial pulses address two sideband orders.
    The two pulses in each radial direction either address $\Delta n=-2$ and $\Delta n=-1$
    or have different durations to drive $\Delta n=-1$,
    at the end of the cooling sequence when most of the population is below $n=3$.
    The Raman cooling and spectroscopy pulses have Blackman envelopes~\cite{kasevich_laser_1992}
    to reduce off-resonant coupling,
    while the measurement Rabi pulses in Fig.~\ref{fig:na-rsc-rabi-flop}
    have square envelopes to simplify analysis.

    that includes a thermal distribution of motional states~\cite{meekhof_generation_1996}
    as well as off-resonant scattering from the Raman beams.

    The blue lines correspond to a ground state probability of (A-D) $98.1$\% along radial axis
    and (E-F) $95$\% along the axial axis after cooling.
    The red lines correspond to a thermal distribution of $80$ $\mu$K before RSC.
    The horizontal dashed lines in all the plots correspond to the $4\,\%$ probability
    of imaging loss.

    The green dashed line in (F) includes the additional decoherence due to
    a fluctuation of the hyperfine splitting of magnitude $3$ kHz.
    We see that the decoherence effect is strongest for the post-cooling data on
    the axial $\Delta n_z=1$ sideband where the Rabi frequency is the lowest.
