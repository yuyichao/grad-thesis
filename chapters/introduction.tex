\section{Ultracold Molecules}
\label{ch:introduction:molecules}

\todo{
  Starting from precise spectroscopy and laser cooling
  Thanks to high level of control, ultra neutral atoms has been .......
  Simple and weak interaction

  Molecules, rich internal degrees of freedom, larger interactions.
  Compared to ion, rydberg, longer live, tunable interaction
  (expand on the applications)

  The properties that makes molecules, however,
  makes cooling and controlling the molecules much harder than atoms.
  The additional degrees of freedom greatly increases the number of states
  to control and the lack of a cycling transition in general in molecules
  limits the number of photon one can scatter off of the molecules which
  affects laser cooling.

\todo{
  Association of molecules
