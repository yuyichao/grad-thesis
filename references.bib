The correction terms are of the magnitude of Be2{$\omega$}e2. Formulas for the effect of the correction terms on isotope shifts are given, and for the calculation of the correction terms themselves. Also a method is given for obtaining actual potential functions from band spectrum data, based on Morse's potential function.

The triplet and singlet scattering lengths are measured by performing Raman spectroscopy of the Na-Cs motional states and least-bound molecular state in the tweezer. The two-scale MQDT improves accuracy over the single-scale model by incorporating the -C8/r8 potential in addition to the -C6/r6 potential. Magnetic Feshbach resonances are observed for only two atoms at fields which agree to within 1\% of the MQDT predictions. Our tweezer-based approach, combined with an effective theory of interaction, provides a methodology for future studies of more complex interactions, such as atom-molecule and molecule-molecule interactions, and where the traditional high-phase-space-density bulk-gas techniques are technically challenging.},

The light shifts of atomic levels from the trapping potential in these systems can result in detrimental effects such as fluctuating dipole force heating, inhomogeneous detunings, and inhibition of laser cooling, which limits the atomic species that can be manipulated. In particular, these light shifts can be large enough to prevent loading into optical tweezers directly from a magneto-optical trap. We present a general solution to these limitations by loading, cooling, and imaging single atoms with temporally alternating beams. Because this technique does not depend on any specific spectral properties, we expect it to enable the optical tweezer method to control nearly any atomic or molecular species that can be laser cooled and optically trapped. Furthermore, we present an analysis of the role of heating and required cooling for single atom tweezer loading.},

Our demonstration shows that an optical tweezer, formed simply by a tightly focused beam of light, creates sufficient confinement for efficient sideband cooling. This source of ground-state neutral atoms will be instrumental in numerous quantum simulation and logic applications that require a versatile platform for storing and manipulating ultracold single neutral atoms.

It is possible to manipulate atoms more deliberately with a scanning tunneling microscope tip, but the process is then confined to a surface. Liu et al. directly manipulated individual atoms with light to form single molecules in isolation (see the Perspective by Narevicius). They used optical tweezers of two different colors to selectively steer ultracold sodium (Na) and cesium (Cs) atoms together. A subsequent optical excitation formed NaCs. Science, this issue p. 900; see also p. 855 Chemical reactions typically proceed via stochastic encounters between reactants. Going beyond this paradigm, we combined exactly two atoms in a single, controlled reaction. The experimental apparatus traps two individual laser-cooled atoms [one sodium (Na) and one cesium (Cs)] in separate optical tweezers and then merges them into one optical dipole trap. Subsequently, photoassociation forms an excited-state NaCs molecule. The discovery of previously unseen resonances near the molecular dissociation threshold and measurement of collision rates are enabled by the tightly trapped ultracold sample of atoms. As laser-cooling and trapping capabilities are extended to more elements, the technique will enable the study of more diverse, and eventually more complex, molecules in an isolated environment, as well as synthesis of designer molecules for qubits. Optical tweezers at distinct wavelengths poise individual sodium and cesium atoms sufficiently close together to form a NaCs molecule.

  abstract = {Recent theoretical and experimental advances have led to better understanding and control of simple molecules, bringing them to the forefront of quantum science. Diatomic polar molecules, with their vibrational and rotational degrees of freedom and electric dipole moment, are excellent candidates for a scalable qubit, probes of beyond-Standard Model physics, and quantum simulation of topological and chiral many-body systems. These applications call for high-phase space density (PSD) of molecules in a single quantum state. To date, the highest molecular PSD is achieved by coherently associating degenerate quantum gases of atoms into molecules. However, this requires fine-tuning of experimental parameters to maximize spatial overlap of the atomic density distributions while minimizing three-body recombination of the atoms. In this thesis, we propose a bottom-up solution to gain single particle control of ultracold molecules for the first time. We use optical tweezers to deterministically assemble a single NaCs molecule in a single quantum state from a pair of Na and Cs atoms. Added benefits of using optical tweezers include: tight confinement of isolated atoms enabling cooling of Na and Cs to their quantum ground state of motion in less than 100\textasciitilde ms, and dynamic reconfigurability of optical tweezer arrays which will allow scaling up to defect-free arrays of single molecules.  In the process, we realize a conceptually simple platform for studying atomic collisions and molecular spectra which derives its strength from the ability to gather "before" and "after" images of single atoms.},

  abstract = {Chemical reactions can be surprisingly efficient at ultracold temperatures ( {$<$} 1mK) due to the wave nature of atoms and molecules. The study of reactions in the ultracold regime is a new research frontier enabled by cooling and trapping techniques developed in atomic and molecular physics. In addition, ultracold molecular gases that offer diverse molecular internal states and large electric dipolar interactions are sought after for studies of strongly interacting many-body quantum physics. Here we propose a new approach for producing ultracold molecules in the absolute internal and motional quantum ground state, where single molecules are assembled one by one from individual atoms. The scheme involves laser cooling, optical trapping, Raman sideband cooling, and coherent molecular state transfer. As a crucial initial step, we demonstrate quantum control of constituent atoms, including 3D ground-state cooling of a single Cs atom, in a simple apparatus. As laser technology advances to shorter wavelengths, additional atoms will be amenable to laser-cooling, allowing more diverse, and eventually more complex, molecules to be assembled with full quantum control.},

  abstract = {State-selected rubidium-87 molecules were created at rest in a dilute Bose-Einstein condensate of rubidium-87 atoms with coherent free-bound stimulated Raman transitions. The transition rate exhibited a resonance line shape with an extremely narrow width as small as 1.5 kilohertz. The precise shape and position of the resonance are sensitive to the mean-field interactions between the molecules and the atomic condensate. As a result, we were able to measure the molecule-condensate interactions. This method allows molecular binding energies to be determined with unprecedented accuracy and is of interest as a mechanism for the generation of a molecular Bose-Einstein condensate.},

  abstract = {We report Raman sideband cooling of a single sodium atom to its three-dimensional motional ground state in an optical tweezer. Despite a large Lamb-Dicke parameter, high initial temperature, and large differential light shifts between the excited state and the ground state, we achieve a ground state population of \$93.5(7)\$\% after \$53\$ ms of cooling. Our technique includes addressing high-order sidebands, where several motional quanta are removed by a single laser pulse, and fast modulation of the optical tweezer intensity. We demonstrate that Raman sideband cooling to the 3D motional ground state is possible, even without tight confinement and low initial temperature.},

  abstract = {We demonstrate the formation of a single NaCs molecule in an optical tweezer by magnetoassociation through an s-wave Feshbach resonance at 864.11(5) G. Starting from single atoms cooled to their motional ground states, we achieve conversion efficiencies of 47(1)\%, and measure a molecular lifetime of 4.7(7) ms. By construction, the single molecules are predominantly [77(5)\%] in the center-of-mass motional ground state of the tweezer. Furthermore, we produce a single p-wave molecule near 807 G by first preparing one of the atoms with one quantum of motional excitation. Our creation of a single weakly bound molecule in a designated internal state in the motional ground state of an optical tweezer is a crucial step towards coherent control of single molecules in optical tweezer arrays.},
