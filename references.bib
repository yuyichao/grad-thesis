  abstract = {Tweezing cold molecules Arrays of optical tweezers have been used to trap atoms, but trapping and laser-cooling molecules in this setting is tricky. Such an approach would, however, be generalizable to many molecular species. Anderegg et al. created an optical tweezer array of calcium monofluoride molecules, which were laser cooled to their ground state (see the Perspective by Kotochigova). By distinguishing between single and multiple molecules in the tweezers, the researchers were able to observe molecular collisions. Boasting exquisite control over individual molecules, the optical tweezer array platform holds much promise for extending the applications of ultracold molecules. Science, this issue p. 1156; see also p. 1079 Ultracold molecules have important applications that range from quantum simulation and computation to precision measurements probing physics beyond the Standard Model. Optical tweezer arrays of laser-cooled molecules, which allow control of individual particles, offer a platform for realizing this full potential. In this work, we report on creating an optical tweezer array of laser-cooled calcium monofluoride molecules. This platform has also allowed us to observe ground-state collisions of laser-cooled molecules both in the presence and absence of near-resonant light. CaF molecules were laser cooled and trapped in a one-dimensional array of optical tweezers. CaF molecules were laser cooled and trapped in a one-dimensional array of optical tweezers.},

We develop an exact diagonalization approach to the coupling between center-of-mass and relative motion and numerically determine the spectrum of the system.

In the limit of small Rayleigh scattering rates, the presence of a second pump beam suppresses superradiance, whereas at large Rayleigh scattering rates it lowers the effective threshold power for collective light scattering. In the latter regime, the quench dynamics of the two-beam system are oscillatory, compared to monotonic in the single-beam case. In addition, the dependence on power, detuning, and atom number is explored. The observed features of the two-beam system qualitatively agree with the recent theoretical prediction of a supersolid crystalline phase of light and matter at large Rayleigh scattering rates.},

These atoms have open 4f or 5f shells making the calculations complicated. We use our special version of the configuration-interaction method combined with the many-body perturbation theory method adopted for an open f-shell case. To validate the method we perform similar calculations for simpler atoms (Xe, Hg, Tl+, Pb, Pb2+, Rn, Ra), where some earlier results are available.

However, conventional methods of producing such molecules are attainable only for a limited number of systems or they suffer for strong dephasing. He et al. sought to pair atoms, through coupling of their spins, to the two-body relative motion mediated by the inherent polarization gradients in a strongly focused trapping laser. They report a successful assembly of an ultracold 87Rb-85Rb molecule in an optical tweezer and observed coherent, long-lived atom-molecule Rabi oscillations. They further demonstrate the full control of the internal and external degrees of freedom in the atom-molecule system. Science, this issue p. 331 Ultracold single molecules have wide-ranging potential applications, such as ultracold chemistry, precision measurements, quantum simulation, and quantum computation. However, given the difficulty of achieving full control of a complex atom-molecule system, the coherent formation of single molecules remains a challenge. Here, we report an alternative route to coherently bind two atoms into a weakly bound molecule at megahertz levels by coupling atomic spins to their two-body relative motion in a strongly focused laser with inherent polarization gradients. The coherent nature is demonstrated by long-lived atom-molecule Rabi oscillations. We further manipulate the motional levels of the molecules and measure the binding energy precisely. This work opens the door to full control of all degrees of freedom in atom-molecule systems. Two alkali atoms are coherently paired into a molecule in an optical tweezer without the use of a Feshbach resonance.

  abstract = {The multichannel Na-Cs interactions are characterized by a series of measurements using two atoms in an optical tweezer, along with a multichannel quantum defect theory (MQDT) with minimal input parameters. The triplet and singlet scattering lengths are measured by performing Raman spectroscopy of the Na-Cs motional states and least-bound molecular state in the tweezer. The two-scale MQDT improves accuracy over the single-scale model by incorporating the -C8/r8 potential in addition to the -C6/r6 potential. Magnetic Feshbach resonances are observed for only two atoms at fields which agree to within 1\% of the MQDT predictions. Our tweezer-based approach, combined with an effective theory of interaction, provides a methodology for future studies of more complex interactions, such as atom-molecule and molecule-molecule interactions, and where the traditional high-phase-space-density bulk-gas techniques are technically challenging.},

  abstract = {Glimpsing an exchange of partners When two diatomic molecules collide, they can sometimes swap partners. For instance, two potassium-rubidium (KRb) molecules can produce K2 and Rb2. The four-atom intermediate formed upon collision is typically too scarce and short-lived to spot, even using ultrafast techniques. Hu et al. circumvented this problem by studying the reaction at temperatures approaching 0 kelvin. Using a combination of mass spectrometry and velocity-map imaging, the authors directly characterized the ionized K2Rb2 complex as well as the reactant and product populations. Science, this issue p. 1111 Femtochemistry techniques have been instrumental in accessing the short time scales necessary to probe transient intermediates in chemical reactions. In this study, we took the contrasting approach of prolonging the lifetime of an intermediate by preparing reactant molecules in their lowest rovibronic quantum state at ultralow temperatures, thereby markedly reducing the number of exit channels accessible upon their mutual collision. Using ionization spectroscopy and velocity-map imaging of a trapped gas of potassium-rubidium (KRb) molecules at a temperature of 500 nanokelvin, we directly observed reactants, intermediates, and products of the reaction 40K87Rb + 40K87Rb \textrightarrow{} K2Rb2* \textrightarrow{} K2 + Rb2. Beyond observation of a long-lived, energy-rich intermediate complex, this technique opens the door to further studies of quantum-state\textendash resolved reaction dynamics in the ultracold regime.

The use of oscillating dipole moments, as opposed to static electric dipoles, dynamically decouples the dipoles from laboratory fields, including the electric fields of the trap itself. Further, this implementation does not require the quantum control of motion, potentially removing a major roadblock to ion trap quantum computing scalability.

  abstract = {The electron is predicted to be slightly aspheric, with a distortion characterized by the electric dipole moment (EDM), d(e). No experiment has ever detected this deviation. The standard model of particle physics predicts that d(e) is far too small to detect, being some eleven orders of magnitude smaller than the current experimental sensitivity. However, many extensions to the standard model naturally predict much larger values of d(e) that should be detectable. This makes the search for the electron EDM a powerful way to search for new physics and constrain the possible extensions. In particular, the popular idea that new supersymmetric particles may exist at masses of a few hundred GeV/c(2) (where c is the speed of light) is difficult to reconcile with the absence of an electron EDM at the present limit of sensitivity. The size of the EDM is also intimately related to the question of why the Universe has so little antimatter. If the reason is that some undiscovered particle interaction breaks the symmetry between matter and antimatter, this should result in a measurable EDM in most models of particle physics. Here we use cold polar molecules to measure the electron EDM at the highest level of precision reported so far, providing a constraint on any possible new interactions. We obtain d(e) = (-2.4 {$\pm$} 5.7(stat) {$\pm$} 1.5(syst)) \texttimes{} 10(-28)e cm, where e is the charge on the electron, which sets a new upper limit of |d(e)| \textbackslash textless 10.5 \texttimes{} 10(-28)e cm with 90 per cent confidence. This result, consistent with zero, indicates that the electron is spherical at this improved level of precision. Our measurement of atto-electronvolt energy shifts in a molecule probes new physics at the tera-electronvolt energy scale.},

The light shifts of atomic levels from the trapping potential in these systems can result in detrimental effects such as fluctuating dipole force heating, inhomogeneous detunings, and inhibition of laser cooling, which limits the atomic species that can be manipulated. In particular, these light shifts can be large enough to prevent loading into optical tweezers directly from a magneto-optical trap. We present a general solution to these limitations by loading, cooling, and imaging single atoms with temporally alternating beams. Because this technique does not depend on any specific spectral properties, we expect it to enable the optical tweezer method to control nearly any atomic or molecular species that can be laser cooled and optically trapped. Furthermore, we present an analysis of the role of heating and required cooling for single atom tweezer loading.},

It is possible to manipulate atoms more deliberately with a scanning tunneling microscope tip, but the process is then confined to a surface. Liu et al. directly manipulated individual atoms with light to form single molecules in isolation (see the Perspective by Narevicius). They used optical tweezers of two different colors to selectively steer ultracold sodium (Na) and cesium (Cs) atoms together. A subsequent optical excitation formed NaCs. Science, this issue p. 900; see also p. 855 Chemical reactions typically proceed via stochastic encounters between reactants. Going beyond this paradigm, we combined exactly two atoms in a single, controlled reaction. The experimental apparatus traps two individual laser-cooled atoms [one sodium (Na) and one cesium (Cs)] in separate optical tweezers and then merges them into one optical dipole trap. Subsequently, photoassociation forms an excited-state NaCs molecule. The discovery of previously unseen resonances near the molecular dissociation threshold and measurement of collision rates are enabled by the tightly trapped ultracold sample of atoms. As laser-cooling and trapping capabilities are extended to more elements, the technique will enable the study of more diverse, and eventually more complex, molecules in an isolated environment, as well as synthesis of designer molecules for qubits.

  abstract = {Recent theoretical and experimental advances have led to better understanding and control of simple molecules, bringing them to the forefront of quantum science. Diatomic polar molecules, with their vibrational and rotational degrees of freedom and electric dipole moment, are excellent candidates for a scalable qubit, probes of beyond-Standard Model physics, and quantum simulation of topological and chiral many-body systems. These applications call for high-phase space density (PSD) of molecules in a single quantum state. To date, the highest molecular PSD is achieved by coherently associating degenerate quantum gases of atoms into molecules. However, this requires fine-tuning of experimental parameters to maximize spatial overlap of the atomic density distributions while minimizing three-body recombination of the atoms. In this thesis, we propose a bottom-up solution to gain single particle control of ultracold molecules for the first time. We use optical tweezers to deterministically assemble a single NaCs molecule in a single quantum state from a pair of Na and Cs atoms. Added benefits of using optical tweezers include: tight confinement of isolated atoms enabling cooling of Na and Cs to their quantum ground state of motion in less than 100\textasciitilde ms, and dynamic reconfigurability of optical tweezer arrays which will allow scaling up to defect-free arrays of single molecules.  In the process, we realize a conceptually simple platform for studying atomic collisions and molecular spectra which derives its strength from the ability to gather "before" and "after" images of single atoms.},

All three states are insensitive to external magnetic and electric fields. Impacts on gate fidelity due to coupling to other molecular states, imperfect ground-state cooling, blackbody radiation and vacuum spontaneous emission are small, leading to potential fidelity above 99.99\% in a coherent quantum system that can be scaled by purely optical means.},

  abstract = {A quantum gas of ultracold polar molecules, with long-range and anisotropic interactions, not only would enable explorations of a large class of many-body physics phenomena but also could be used for quantum information processing. We report on the creation of an ultracold dense gas of potassium-rubidium (40K87Rb) polar molecules. Using a single step of STIRAP (stimulated Raman adiabatic passage) with two-frequency laser irradiation, we coherently transfer extremely weakly bound KRb molecules to the rovibrational ground state of either the triplet or the singlet electronic ground molecular potential. The polar molecular gas has a peak density of 1012 per cubic centimeter and an expansion-determined translational temperature of 350 nanokelvin. The polar molecules have a permanent electric dipole moment, which we measure with Stark spectroscopy to be 0.052(2) Debye (1 Debye = 3.336 \texttimes{} 10\textendash 30 coulomb-meters) for the triplet rovibrational ground state and 0.566(17) Debye for the singlet rovibrational ground state. Raman laser irradiation can cool a cloud of KRb molecules to ultralow translational, vibrational, and rotational temperatures, a step toward forming molecular condensates.

Recent achievements in this direction have used either trapped ions1,2,3 or trapped photons in cavity quantum-electrodynamical systems3,4. A third possibility that has been studied theoretically5,6 is to use trapped neutral atoms. Such schemes would benefit greatly from the ability to trap and address individual atoms with high spatial resolution. Here we demonstrate a method for loading and detecting individual atoms in an optical dipole trap of submicrometre size. Because of the extremely small trapping volume, only one atom can be loaded at a time, so that the statistics of the number of atoms in the trap, N, are strongly sub-poissonian ({$\Delta$}N2\,{$\approx$}\,0.5N). We present a simple model for describing the observed behaviour, and we discuss the possibilities for trapping and addressing several atoms in separate traps, for applications in quantum information processing.},

We achieve vibrational occupation numbers of \$\textbackslash backslashbar\{n\}\_r = 0.01\$ and \$\textbackslash backslashbar\{n\}\_a = 8\$ in the radial and axial directions of the trap, corresponding to an rms size of the atomic wavepacket of 24 nm and 270 nm, respectively.

We show that anisotropic dipole\textendash dipole interactions between molecules can lead to effective spin\textendash spin interactions which exchange spin and orbital angular momentum. This exchange produces effective spin models which do not conserve magnetization and feature tunable degrees of spatial and spin\textendash coupling anisotropy. In addition to deriving pure spin models when molecules are pinned in a deep optical lattice, we show that models of itinerant magnetism are possible when molecules can tunnel through the lattice. Additionally, we demonstrate rich tunability of effective model parameters using only a single microwave frequency, in contrast to proposals with diatomic molecules, which often require many microwave frequencies. Our results are germane not only for experiments with polyatomic symmetric top molecules, such as methyl fluoride (CH3F), but also diatomic molecules with an effective symmetric top structure, such as the hydroxyl radical OH.},
