Producing trapped, dense samples of ultracold molecules is a challenging task. One promising approach is direct laser cooling, which can be applied to several classes of molecules not easily assembled from ultracold atoms12,13. Here, we report the production of trapped samples of laser-cooled CaF molecules with densities of 8\,\texttimes\,107 cm-3 and at phase-space densities of 2\,\texttimes\,10-9, 35 times higher than for sub-Doppler-cooled samples in free space14. These advances are made possible by efficient laser cooling of optically trapped molecules to well below the Doppler limit, a key step towards many future applications. These range from ultracold chemistry to quantum simulation, where conservative trapping of cold and dense samples is desirable. In addition, the ability to cool optically trapped molecules opens up new paths towards quantum degeneracy.},

Such an approach would, however, be generalizable to many molecular species. Anderegg et al. created an optical tweezer array of calcium monofluoride molecules, which were laser cooled to their ground state (see the Perspective by Kotochigova). By distinguishing between single and multiple molecules in the tweezers, the researchers were able to observe molecular collisions. Boasting exquisite control over individual molecules, the optical tweezer array platform holds much promise for extending the applications of ultracold molecules. Science, this issue p. 1156; see also p. 1079 Ultracold molecules have important applications that range from quantum simulation and computation to precision measurements probing physics beyond the Standard Model. Optical tweezer arrays of laser-cooled molecules, which allow control of individual particles, offer a platform for realizing this full potential. In this work, we report on creating an optical tweezer array of laser-cooled calcium monofluoride molecules. This platform has also allowed us to observe ground-state collisions of laser-cooled molecules both in the presence and absence of near-resonant light. CaF molecules were laser cooled and trapped in a one-dimensional array of optical tweezers. CaF molecules were laser cooled and trapped in a one-dimensional array of optical tweezers.},

In our experiment, we create a translationally ultracold, dense quantum gas of molecules bound by more than 1000 wave numbers in the electronic ground state. Specifically, we stimulate with 80\% efficiency, a two-photon transfer of molecules associated on a Feshbach resonance from a Bose-Einstein condensate of cesium atoms. In the process, the initial loose, long-range electrostatic bond of the Feshbach molecule is coherently transformed into a tight chemical bond. We demonstrate coherence of the transfer in a Ramsey-type experiment and show that the molecular sample is not heated during the transfer. Our results show that the preparation of a quantum gas of molecules in specific rovibrational states is possible and that the creation of a Bose-Einstein condensate of molecules in their rovibronic ground state is within reach. A coherent Raman pumping scheme cools cesium molecules to a state with minimal rotational energy, needed for producing cold molecular Bose-Einstein condensates.

We develop an exact diagonalization approach to the coupling between center-of-mass and relative motion and numerically determine the spectrum of the system.

In the latter regime, the quench dynamics of the two-beam system are oscillatory, compared to monotonic in the single-beam case. In addition, the dependence on power, detuning, and atom number is explored. The observed features of the two-beam system qualitatively agree with the recent theoretical prediction of a supersolid crystalline phase of light and matter at large Rayleigh scattering rates.},

The YO ground state is thus comprised of two manifolds of closely spaced states, with one of them possessing a negligible Landé g factor. This unique energy level structure favors dual-frequency dc magneto-optical trapping (MOT) and gray molasses cooling (GMC). We report exceptionally robust cooling of YO at $4~\mathrm{\mu K}$ over a wide range of laser intensity, detunings (one- and two-photon), and magnetic field. The magnetic insensitivity enables the spatial compression of the molecular cloud by alternating GMC and MOT under the continuous operation of the quadrupole magnetic field.

Starting from weakly bound Feshbach molecules formed via magnetoassociation, the lowest rovibrational and hyperfine level of the electronic ground state is populated following a high-efficiency and high-resolution two-photon Raman process. The high-purity absolute ground-state samples have up to 8000 molecules and densities of over $10^{11}~\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$. By measuring the Stark shifts induced by external electric fields, we determined the permanent electric dipole moment of the absolute ground-state $\mathrm{^{23}Na^{87}Rb}$ and demonstrated the capability of inducing an effective dipole moment over $1~\mathrm{D}$. Bimolecular reaction between ground-state $\mathrm{^{23}Na^{87}Rb}$ molecules is endothermic, but we still observed a rather fast decay of the molecular sample.

However, conventional methods of producing such molecules are attainable only for a limited number of systems or they suffer for strong dephasing. He et al. sought to pair atoms, through coupling of their spins, to the two-body relative motion mediated by the inherent polarization gradients in a strongly focused trapping laser. They report a successful assembly of an ultracold 87Rb-85Rb molecule in an optical tweezer and observed coherent, long-lived atom-molecule Rabi oscillations. They further demonstrate the full control of the internal and external degrees of freedom in the atom-molecule system. Science, this issue p. 331 Ultracold single molecules have wide-ranging potential applications, such as ultracold chemistry, precision measurements, quantum simulation, and quantum computation. However, given the difficulty of achieving full control of a complex atom-molecule system, the coherent formation of single molecules remains a challenge. Here, we report an alternative route to coherently bind two atoms into a weakly bound molecule at megahertz levels by coupling atomic spins to their two-body relative motion in a strongly focused laser with inherent polarization gradients. The coherent nature is demonstrated by long-lived atom-molecule Rabi oscillations. We further manipulate the motional levels of the molecules and measure the binding energy precisely. This work opens the door to full control of all degrees of freedom in atom-molecule systems.

The triplet and singlet scattering lengths are measured by performing Raman spectroscopy of the Na-Cs motional states and least-bound molecular state in the tweezer. The two-scale MQDT improves accuracy over the single-scale model by incorporating the -C8/r8 potential in addition to the -C6/r6 potential. Magnetic Feshbach resonances are observed for only two atoms at fields which agree to within 1\% of the MQDT predictions.

Science, this issue p. 1111 Femtochemistry techniques have been instrumental in accessing the short time scales necessary to probe transient intermediates in chemical reactions. In this study, we took the contrasting approach of prolonging the lifetime of an intermediate by preparing reactant molecules in their lowest rovibronic quantum state at ultralow temperatures, thereby markedly reducing the number of exit channels accessible upon their mutual collision. Using ionization spectroscopy and velocity-map imaging of a trapped gas of potassium-rubidium (KRb) molecules at a temperature of 500 nanokelvin, we directly observed reactants, intermediates, and products of the reaction 40K87Rb + 40K87Rb \textrightarrow{} K2Rb2* \textrightarrow{} K2 + Rb2.

  abstract = {The electron is predicted to be slightly aspheric, with a distortion characterized by the electric dipole moment (EDM), d(e). No experiment has ever detected this deviation. The standard model of particle physics predicts that d(e) is far too small to detect, being some eleven orders of magnitude smaller than the current experimental sensitivity. However, many extensions to the standard model naturally predict much larger values of d(e) that should be detectable. This makes the search for the electron EDM a powerful way to search for new physics and constrain the possible extensions. In particular, the popular idea that new supersymmetric particles may exist at masses of a few hundred GeV/c(2) (where c is the speed of light) is difficult to reconcile with the absence of an electron EDM at the present limit of sensitivity. The size of the EDM is also intimately related to the question of why the Universe has so little antimatter. If the reason is that some undiscovered particle interaction breaks the symmetry between matter and antimatter, this should result in a measurable EDM in most models of particle physics. Here we use cold polar molecules to measure the electron EDM at the highest level of precision reported so far, providing a constraint on any possible new interactions. We obtain d(e) = (-2.4 {$\pm$} 5.7(stat) {$\pm$} 1.5(syst)) \texttimes{} 10(-28)e cm, where e is the charge on the electron, which sets a new upper limit of |d(e)| \textbackslash textless 10.5 \texttimes{} 10(-28)e cm with 90 per cent confidence. This result, consistent with zero, indicates that the electron is spherical at this improved level of precision.

The light shifts of atomic levels from the trapping potential in these systems can result in detrimental effects such as fluctuating dipole force heating, inhomogeneous detunings, and inhibition of laser cooling, which limits the atomic species that can be manipulated. In particular, these light shifts can be large enough to prevent loading into optical tweezers directly from a magneto-optical trap. We present a general solution to these limitations by loading, cooling, and imaging single atoms with temporally alternating beams. Because this technique does not depend on any specific spectral properties, we expect it to enable the optical tweezer method to control nearly any atomic or molecular species that can be laser cooled and optically trapped. Furthermore, we present an analysis of the role of heating and required cooling for single atom tweezer loading.},

Liu et al. directly manipulated individual atoms with light to form single molecules in isolation (see the Perspective by Narevicius). They used optical tweezers of two different colors to selectively steer ultracold sodium (Na) and cesium (Cs) atoms together. A subsequent optical excitation formed NaCs. Science, this issue p. 900; see also p. 855 Chemical reactions typically proceed via stochastic encounters between reactants. Going beyond this paradigm, we combined exactly two atoms in a single, controlled reaction. The experimental apparatus traps two individual laser-cooled atoms [one sodium (Na) and one cesium (Cs)] in separate optical tweezers and then merges them into one optical dipole trap. Subsequently, photoassociation forms an excited-state NaCs molecule. The discovery of previously unseen resonances near the molecular dissociation threshold and measurement of collision rates are enabled by the tightly trapped ultracold sample of atoms. As laser-cooling and trapping capabilities are extended to more elements, the technique will enable the study of more diverse, and eventually more complex, molecules in an isolated environment, as well as synthesis of designer molecules for qubits.

  abstract = {Recent theoretical and experimental advances have led to better understanding and control of simple molecules, bringing them to the forefront of quantum science. Diatomic polar molecules, with their vibrational and rotational degrees of freedom and electric dipole moment, are excellent candidates for a scalable qubit, probes of beyond-Standard Model physics, and quantum simulation of topological and chiral many-body systems. These applications call for high-phase space density (PSD) of molecules in a single quantum state. To date, the highest molecular PSD is achieved by coherently associating degenerate quantum gases of atoms into molecules. However, this requires fine-tuning of experimental parameters to maximize spatial overlap of the atomic density distributions while minimizing three-body recombination of the atoms. In this thesis, we propose a bottom-up solution to gain single particle control of ultracold molecules for the first time. We use optical tweezers to deterministically assemble a single NaCs molecule in a single quantum state from a pair of Na and Cs atoms. Added benefits of using optical tweezers include: tight confinement of isolated atoms enabling cooling of Na and Cs to their quantum ground state of motion in less than 100\textasciitilde ms, and dynamic reconfigurability of optical tweezer arrays which will allow scaling up to defect-free arrays of single molecules.  In the process, we realize a conceptually simple platform for studying atomic collisions and molecular spectra which derives its strength from the ability to gather "before" and "after" images of single atoms.},

Our demonstration includes 3D ground-state cooling of a single atom (Cs) in an optical tweezer, transport by several microns with minimal heating, and merging with a single Na atom. Subsequently, both atoms occupy the simultaneous motional ground state with 61(4)\textbackslash\% probability. This realizes a sample of exactly two co-trapped atoms near the phase-space-density limit of one, and allows for efficient stimulated-Raman transfer of a pair of atoms into a molecular bound state of the triplet electronic ground potential \$a\^3\textbackslash Sigma\^+\$.

  abstract = {Chemical reactions can be surprisingly efficient at ultracold temperatures ( {$<$} 1mK) due to the wave nature of atoms and molecules. The study of reactions in the ultracold regime is a new research frontier enabled by cooling and trapping techniques developed in atomic and molecular physics. In addition, ultracold molecular gases that offer diverse molecular internal states and large electric dipolar interactions are sought after for studies of strongly interacting many-body quantum physics. Here we propose a new approach for producing ultracold molecules in the absolute internal and motional quantum ground state, where single molecules are assembled one by one from individual atoms. The scheme involves laser cooling, optical trapping, Raman sideband cooling, and coherent molecular state transfer. As a crucial initial step, we demonstrate quantum control of constituent atoms, including 3D ground-state cooling of a single Cs atom, in a simple apparatus. As laser technology advances to shorter wavelengths, additional atoms will be amenable to laser-cooling, allowing more diverse, and eventually more complex, molecules to be assembled with full quantum control.},

  abstract = {Coaxing quantumness in a molecular gas A dilute atomic gas cooled down to very cold temperatures can enter the so-called quantum degenerate regime, where quantum properties of the gas come to the fore. This regime has been achieved for both bosonic and fermionic atoms, but molecules, with their many internal states, present a special challenge. De Marco et al. cooled a bulk gas of fermionic potassium-rubidium molecules to quantum degeneracy (see the Perspective by Zelevinsky). The authors first cooled atomic potassium and rubidium gases separately, then bound them together into potassium-rubidium molecules, and finally brought the molecules down to their ground state. The density profile of the molecular gas revealed the system's quantum nature, which in turn kept the gas stable by suppressing chemical reactions. Science, this issue p. 853; see also p. 820 Experimental realization of a quantum degenerate gas of molecules would provide access to a wide range of phenomena in molecular and quantum sciences. However, the very complexity that makes ultracold molecules so enticing has made reaching degeneracy an outstanding experimental challenge over the past decade. We now report the production of a degenerate Fermi gas of ultracold polar molecules of potassium-rubidium. Through coherent adiabatic association in a deeply degenerate mixture of a rubidium Bose-Einstein condensate and a potassium Fermi gas, we produce molecules at temperatures below 0.3 times the Fermi temperature. We explore the properties of this reactive gas and demonstrate how degeneracy suppresses chemical reactions, making a long-lived degenerate gas of polar molecules a reality. A bulk gas of fermionic potassium-rubidium molecules is cooled down to below a third of the Fermi temperature.

This two-step process reliably transfers {$\approx$}40\% of the molecules initially trapped in the magneto-optical trap into a single quantum state in the magnetic trap. Once loaded, the molecule cloud is compressed by increasing the magnetic field gradient. We observe a magnetic trap lifetime of over 1 s.

  abstract = {Laser cooling of symmetric top molecule Experimental progress over the past few decades has led to the mastery of ultracold atomic gases. A major thrust of current research is to extend this success to ultracold molecules, which would open qualitatively new perspectives for quantum information science, precision measurement, quantum chemistry, and other fields. The internal degrees of freedom in molecules preclude immediate implementation of conventional methods. Using a specific combination of rovibronic optical transitions, Mitra et al. report direct Sisyphus laser cooling of the symmetric top molecule CaOCH3 to temperatures below 1 millikelvin (see the Perspective by Hudson). The proposed scheme for cooling is potentially applicable to a wide range of nonlinear polyatomic molecules. Science, this issue p. 1366; see also p. 1304 Ultracold polyatomic molecules have potentially wide-ranging applications in quantum simulation and computation, particle physics, and quantum chemistry. For atoms and small molecules, direct laser cooling has proven to be a powerful tool for quantum science in the ultracold regime. However, the feasibility of laser-cooling larger, nonlinear polyatomic molecules has remained unknown because of their complex structure. We laser-cooled the symmetric top molecule calcium monomethoxide (CaOCH3), reducing the temperature of \textasciitilde 104 molecules from 22 {$\pm$} 1 millikelvin to 1.8 {$\pm$} 0.7 millikelvin in one dimension and state-selectively cooling two nuclear spin isomers. These results demonstrate that the use of proper ro-vibronic transitions enables laser cooling of nonlinear molecules, thereby opening a path to efficient cooling of chiral molecules and, eventually, optical tweezer arrays of complex polyatomic species. The symmetric top molecule CaOCH3 is laser-cooled to submillikelvin temperatures. The symmetric top molecule CaOCH3 is laser-cooled to submillikelvin temperatures.},

  abstract = {We produce ultracold dense trapped samples of Rb87Cs133 molecules in their rovibrational ground state, with full nuclear hyperfine state control, by stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) with efficiencies of 90\%. We observe the onset of hyperfine-changing collisions when the magnetic field is ramped so that the molecules are no longer in the hyperfine ground state. A strong quadratic shift of the transition frequencies as a function of applied electric field shows the strongly dipolar character of the RbCs ground-state molecule. Our results open up the prospect of realizing stable bosonic dipolar quantum gases with ultracold molecules.},

  abstract = {We investigate quantum control of a single atom in an optical tweezer trap created by a tightly focused optical beam. We show that longitudinal polarization components in the dipole trap arising from the breakdown of the paraxial approximation give rise to significant internal-state decoherence. We show that this effect can be mitigated by appropriate choice of magnetic bias field, enabling Raman sideband cooling of a single atom close to its three-dimensional ground state in an optical trap with a beam waist as small as \$w=900\$ nm. We achieve vibrational occupation numbers of \$\textbackslash backslashbar\{n\}\_r = 0.01\$ and \$\textbackslash backslashbar\{n\}\_a = 8\$ in the radial and axial directions of the trap, corresponding to an rms size of the atomic wavepacket of 24 nm and 270 nm, respectively. This represents a promising starting point for future hybrid quantum systems where atoms are placed in close proximity to surfaces.},

  abstract = {We demonstrate that ultracold symmetric top molecules loaded into an optical lattice can realize highly tunable and unconventional models of quantum magnetism, such as an XYZ Heisenberg spin model. We show that anisotropic dipole\textendash dipole interactions between molecules can lead to effective spin\textendash spin interactions which exchange spin and orbital angular momentum. This exchange produces effective spin models which do not conserve magnetization and feature tunable degrees of spatial and spin\textendash coupling anisotropy. In addition to deriving pure spin models when molecules are pinned in a deep optical lattice, we show that models of itinerant magnetism are possible when molecules can tunnel through the lattice. Additionally, we demonstrate rich tunability of effective model parameters using only a single microwave frequency, in contrast to proposals with diatomic molecules, which often require many microwave frequencies. Our results are germane not only for experiments with polyatomic symmetric top molecules, such as methyl fluoride (CH3F), but also diatomic molecules with an effective symmetric top structure, such as the hydroxyl radical OH.},

The transition rate exhibited a resonance line shape with an extremely narrow width as small as 1.5 kilohertz. The precise shape and position of the resonance are sensitive to the mean-field interactions between the molecules and the atomic condensate. As a result, we were able to measure the molecule-condensate interactions. This method allows molecular binding energies to be determined with unprecedented accuracy and is of interest as a mechanism for the generation of a molecular Bose-Einstein condensate.},

Motivated by recent advances in the control of ultracold polar molecules and the development of dipolar quantum materials, we show that dipolar interactions between S\,=\,1/2 moments stabilize spin liquids on the triangular and kagome lattices. In the latter case, the moments spontaneously break time-reversal, forming a chiral spin liquid with robust edge modes and emergent semions. We propose a simple route toward synthesizing a dipolar Heisenberg antiferromagnet from lattice-trapped polar molecules using only a single pair of rotational states and a constant electric field.},

Our technique includes addressing high-order sidebands, where several motional quanta are removed by a single laser pulse, and fast modulation of the optical tweezer intensity. We demonstrate that Raman sideband cooling to the 3D motional ground state is possible, even without tight confinement and low initial temperature.},
