%% the abstract
Neutral molecules, with their rich spectrum of internal states as well as
strong and tunable dipolar interactions, are promising candidates for
a broad range of experiments including quantum information,
quantum chemistry, precision measurement and probing of beyond-Standard-Model physics,
and quantum simulation of interacting many-body systems.
At the same time, the complexity that made them attractive also poses a significant challenge
to achieve a high level of quantum control that is required in many of
their potential applications.
Multiple approaches are being pursued for full quantum control of molecules
including association of atomic gases and direct cooling of molecules,
yet it remains challenging to control molecules at single particle level
due to the difficulty in tuning the atom-atom interaction
and laser cooling of molecules.

In this thesis, we successfully achieved coherent association of
weakly bound ground state molecules.
By combining the mature techniques for quantum control of atoms
and the resolution and flexibility of optical tweezers,
we developed a versatile platform to study interactions between single atoms
and properties of single molecules.
Based on these study, we proposed a promising pathway
for coherent all-optical creation of molecules
and demostrated full control on the molecule including all degrees of freedoms.
