\todo{
  neutral Molecules have structures/dipole interactions.
  Molecules are promising for ...
  In order to take full advantage, need high level of quantum control on single molecules.
  which poses high level of challenge due to
  multiple approaches has been taken like .... which requires ... or ....

  In this thesis, we successfully achieved full quantum control
  on a stable weakly bound molecule associated via optical transfer from atoms.
  use optical tweezer to achieve control
  optical tweezers also allows scaling up.
  Studied various interaction and molecule properties.
