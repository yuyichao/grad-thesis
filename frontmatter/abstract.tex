%% the abstract
Neutral molecules, with their rich spectrum of internal states as well as
strong and tunable dipolar interactions, are promising candidates for
a broad range of experiments including quantum information,
quantum chemistry, precision measurement and probing of beyond-Standard-Model physics,
and quantum simulation of interacting many-body systems.
At the same time, the complexity that made them attractive also poses a significant challenge
to achieve a high level of quantum control that is required in many of
their potential applications.
Multiple approaches are being pursued for full quantum control of molecules
including association of atomic gases and direct cooling of molecules,
yet it remains challenging to control molecules at single particle level
due to the difficulty in tuning the atom-atom interaction
and laser cooling of molecules.

\todo{
  In this thesis, we successfully achieved full quantum control
  on a stable weakly bound molecule associated via optical transfer from atoms.
  use optical tweezer to achieve control
  optical tweezers also allows scaling up.
  Studied various interaction and molecule properties.
