%% the acknowledgments section
Many thanks are owed to Kang-Kuen Ni, my advisor,
for the vision on the experiment and giving me the opportunity
to participate in extending the AMO toolbox and our understanding of quantum physics
as a graduate student.
I also learnt from her the way to do research and to manage an experiment,
especially on focusing on the big picture and setting the correct priority.

Of course, none of the work included in this thesis would have been possible
without the collaboration and support from many other people in the lab.
