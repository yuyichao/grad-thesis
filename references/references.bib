	abstract = {Microscopically controlled neutral atoms in optical tweezers and lattices have led to exciting advances in the study of quantum information and quantum many-body systems. The light shifts of atomic levels from the trapping potential in these systems can result in detrimental effects such as fluctuating dipole force heating, inhomogeneous detunings, and inhibition of laser cooling, which limits the atomic species that can be manipulated. In particular, these light shifts can be large enough to prevent loading into optical tweezers directly from a magneto-optical trap. We present a general solution to these limitations by loading, cooling, and imaging single atoms with temporally alternating beams. Because this technique does not depend on any specific spectral properties, we expect it to enable the optical tweezer method to control nearly any atomic or molecular species that can be laser cooled and optically trapped. Furthermore, we present an analysis of the role of heating and required cooling for single atom tweezer loading.},

	abstract = {Chemical reactions can be surprisingly efficient at ultracold temperatures ( {\textless} 1mK) due to the wave nature of atoms and molecules. The study of reactions in the ultracold regime is a new research frontier enabled by cooling and trapping techniques developed in atomic and molecular physics. In addition, ultracold molecular gases that offer diverse molecular internal states and large electric dipolar interactions are sought after for studies of strongly interacting many-body quantum physics. Here we propose a new approach for producing ultracold molecules in the absolute internal and motional quantum ground state, where single molecules are assembled one by one from individual atoms. The scheme involves laser cooling, optical trapping, Raman sideband cooling, and coherent molecular state transfer. As a crucial initial step, we demonstrate quantum control of constituent atoms, including 3D ground-state cooling of a single Cs atom, in a simple apparatus. As laser technology advances to shorter wavelengths, additional atoms will be amenable to laser-cooling, allowing more diverse, and eventually more complex, molecules to be assembled with full quantum control.},

	abstract = {Lighting the way to molecules, one by one
When chemists run reactions, what they are really doing is mixing up an enormous number of reacting partners and then hoping that they collide productively. It is possible to manipulate atoms more deliberately with a scanning tunneling microscope tip, but the process is then confined to a surface. Liu et al. directly manipulated individual atoms with light to form single molecules in isolation (see the Perspective by Narevicius). They used optical tweezers of two different colors to selectively steer ultracold sodium (Na) and cesium (Cs) atoms together. A subsequent optical excitation formed {NaCs}.
Science, this issue p. 900; see also p. 855
Chemical reactions typically proceed via stochastic encounters between reactants. Going beyond this paradigm, we combined exactly two atoms in a single, controlled reaction. The experimental apparatus traps two individual laser-cooled atoms [one sodium (Na) and one cesium (Cs)] in separate optical tweezers and then merges them into one optical dipole trap. Subsequently, photoassociation forms an excited-state {NaCs} molecule. The discovery of previously unseen resonances near the molecular dissociation threshold and measurement of collision rates are enabled by the tightly trapped ultracold sample of atoms. As laser-cooling and trapping capabilities are extended to more elements, the technique will enable the study of more diverse, and eventually more complex, molecules in an isolated environment, as well as synthesis of designer molecules for qubits.
Optical tweezers at distinct wavelengths poise individual sodium and cesium atoms sufficiently close together to form a {NaCs} molecule.

The triplet and singlet scattering lengths are measured by performing Raman spectroscopy of the Na-Cs motional states and least-bound molecular state in the tweezer. The two-scale {MQDT} improves accuracy over the single-scale model by incorporating the −C8/r8 potential in addition to the −C6/r6 potential. Magnetic Feshbach resonances are observed for only two atoms at fields which agree to within 1\% of the {MQDT} predictions. Our tweezer-based approach, combined with an effective theory of interaction, provides a methodology for future studies of more complex interactions, such as atom-molecule and molecule-molecule interactions, and where the traditional high-phase-space-density bulk-gas techniques are technically challenging.},
